This is mainly because Big Data is not only about data, but also about a complete conceptual and technological stack including raw and processed data, storage, ways of managing data, processing and analytics. A challenge that becomes even trickier is the management of the quality of the data in Big Data environments. More than ever before the need for assessing the Quality-in-Use gains importance since the real contribution\u2013business value\u2013of data can be only estimated in its context of use. Although there exists different Data Quality models for assessing the quality of regular data, none of them has been adapted to Big Data. To fill this gap, we propose the \u201c3As Data Quality-in-Use model\u201d, which is composed of three Data Quality characteristics for assessing the levels of Data Quality-in-Use in Big Data projects: Contextual Adequacy, Operational Adequacy and Temporal Adequacy. The model can be integrated into any sort of Big Data project, as it is independent of any pre-conditions or technologies. The paper shows the way to use the model with a working example. The model accomplishes every challenge related to Data Quality program aimed for Big Data. The main conclusion is that the model can be used as an appropriate way to obtain the Quality-in-Use levels of the input data of the Big Data analysis, and those levels can be understood as indicators of trustworthiness and soundness of the results of the Big Data analysis.","Jorge Merino and Ismael Caballero and Bibiano Rivas and Manuel Serrano and Mario Piattini","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2015.11.024","2016","A Data Quality in Use model for Big Data"],[null,"Xintao Liu and Min Chen and Christophe Claramunt and Michael Batty and Mei-Po Kwan and Ahmad M.

However, before the data can be used its quality must be determined and appropriate regions extracted. Initially, such testing was done manually using graphs or basic rules, such as the value of a variable. With large data sets, such an approach will not work, since the amount of data to tested and the number of potential rules is too large. Therefore, there is a need for automated segmentation of the data set into different components. Such an approach has recently been proposed and tested using various types of industrial data. Although the industrial results are promising, there still remain many unanswered questions including how to handle a priori knowledge, over- or undersegmentation of the data set, and setting the appropriate thresholds for a given application. Solving these problems will provide a robust and reliable method for determining the data quality of a given data set.","Yuri A.W.

Errors for sure occur and how to correct them should be explored.\nMethods\nElectronic health records of 9,197,817 patients and 53,081,148 visits, totaling about 500 million records for 2006\u20132016, were transmitted from eight hospitals into an integrated database. We randomly selected 10% of patients, accumulated the primary keys for their tabulated data, and compared the key numbers in the transmitted data with those of the raw data. Errors were identified based on statistical testing and clinical reasoning.\nResults\nData were recorded in 1573 tables. Among these, 58 (3.7%) had different key numbers, with the maximum of 16.34\/1000. Statistical differences (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were found in 34 (58.6%), of which 15 were caused by changes in diagnostic codes, wrong accounts, or modified orders. For the rest, the differences were related to accumulation of hospital visits over time. In the remaining 24 tables (41.4%) without significant differences, three were revised because of incorrect computer programming or wrong accounts. For the rest, the programming was correct and absolute differences were negligible. The applicability was confirmed using the data of 2,730,883 patients and 15,647,468 patient-visits transmitted during 2017\u20132018, in which 10 (3.5%) tables were corrected.\nConclusion\nSignificant magnitude of inconsistent data does exist during the transmission of big data from diverse sources.

Administrative data and registries can provide important contemporary evidence to inform clinical decision making and the delivery of health services. The following review outlines some important considerations for retrospective studies using administrative health databases and registries. First, these data sources have advantages (e.g. real-world applicability, timely data access, relatively lower research cost) and disadvantages (e.g. potential missing data, selection bias, confounding bias) that may be more or less relevant to different administrative databases or registries. Second, we discuss a framework to guide data source selection and provide a summary of frequently used data sources in vascular surgery research. Third, a retrospective study design warrants pre-planned exposure, outcome and covariate definitions and, when studying an exposure-outcome association, careful consideration of confounders through direct acyclic graphs. Finally, investigators must plan the most appropriate analytic approach and we distinguish descriptive, explanatory, and predictive analyses.","Jean Jacob-Brassard and Charles {de Mestral}","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1053\/j.semvascsurg.2022.09.002","2022","Big Data: Using Databases and Registries"],["The lack of sufficient big data-based approaches impedes the development of human resource management (HRM) research and practices.

However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, which becomes a major factor that prevents them from being used for big data quality prediction. This is because the JIT modeling methods need to update the local regression model using the relevant samples that are searched through the lineal scan of the database during online operation. To solve this issue, the present work proposes a novel hashing-based JIT (HbJIT) modeling method that is suitable for big data quality prediction. In HbJIT, a family of locality-sensitive hash functions is firstly used to hash big data into a set of buckets, in which similar samples are grouped on themselves. During online prediction, HbJIT looks up multiple buckets that have a high probability of containing similar samples of a query object through the intelligent probing scheme, uses the data objects in the buckets as the candidate set of the results, and then filters the candidate objects using a linear scan. After filtering, the most relevant samples are used to construct the local regression model to yield the prediction of the query object. By integrating the multi-probe hashing strategy into the JIT learning framework, HbJIT can not only deal with process nonlinearity and time-varying characteristics but also is applicable to large-scale industrial processes. Experimental results on real-world dataset have demonstrated that the proposed HbJIT is time-efficient in processing large-scale datasets, and greatly reduces the online prediction time without compromising on the prediction accuracy.","Xinmin Zhang and Jiang Zhai and Zhihuan Song and Yuan Li","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/B978-0-323-85159-6.50280-3","2022","Hashing-based just-in-time learning for big data quality prediction"],["Summary\nDiarrhoea is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), despite advances in the management of this condition. Understanding of the causes of diarrhoea in children in LMICs has advanced owing to large multinational studies and big data analytics computing the disease burden, identifying the important variables that have contributed to reducing this burden. The advent of the mobile phone has further enabled the management of childhood diarrhoea by providing both clinical support to health-care workers (such as diagnosis and management) and communicating preventive measures to carers (such as breastfeeding and vaccination reminders) in some settings. There are still challenges in addressing the burden of diarrhoeal diseases, such as incomplete patient information, underrepresented geographical areas, concerns about patient confidentiality, unequal partnerships between study investigators, and the reactive approach to outbreaks. A transparent approach to promote the inclusion of researchers in LMICs could address partnership imbalances. A big data umbrella encompassing cloud-based centralised databases to analyse interlinked human, animal, agricultural, social, and climate data would provide an informative solution to the development of appropriate management protocols in LMICs.","Karen H Keddy and Senjuti Saha and Samuel Kariuki and John Bosco Kalule and Farah Naz Qamar and Zoya Haq and Iruka N Okeke","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/S1473-3099(21)00585-5","2022","Using big data and mobile health to manage diarrhoeal disease in children in low-income and middle-income countries: societal barriers and ethical implications"],["This study aims to develop accounting standards, curriculums, and research to cope with the rapid development of big data.

However, earlier research has determined that many NIS studies are limited by common methodological pitfalls. In this study, we provide the first primer of NIS methodological procedures in the setting of neurosurgical research and review all reported neurosurgical studies using the NIS.\nMethods\nWe designed a protocol for neurosurgical big data research using the NIS, based on our subject matter expertise, NIS documentation, and input and verification from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We subsequently used a comprehensive search strategy to identify all neurosurgical studies using the NIS in the PubMed and MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to August 2021. Studies underwent qualitative categorization (years of NIS studied, neurosurgical subspecialty, age group, and thematic focus of study objective) and analysis of longitudinal trends.\nResults\nWe identified a canonical, 4-step protocol for NIS analysis: study population selection; defining additional clinical variables; identification and coding of outcomes; and statistical analysis. Methodological nuances discussed include identifying neurosurgery-specific admissions, addressing missing data, calculating additional severity and hospital-specific metrics, coding perioperative complications, and applying survey weights to make nationwide estimates. Inherent database limitations and common pitfalls of NIS studies discussed include lack of disease process\u2013specific variables and data after the index admission, inability to calculate certain hospital-specific variables after 2011, performing state-level analyses, conflating hospitalization charges and costs, and not following proper statistical methodology for performing survey-weighted regression. In a systematic review, we identified 647 neurosurgical studies using the NIS. Although almost 60% of studies were reported after 2015, <10% of studies analyzed NIS data after 2015. The average sample size of studies was 507,352 patients (standard deviation\u00a0= 2,739,900). Most studies analyzed cranial procedures (58.1%) and adults (68.1%). The most prevalent topic areas analyzed were surgical outcome trends (35.7%) and health policy and economics (17.8%), whereas patient disparities (9.4%) and surgeon or hospital volume (6.6%) were the least studied.\nConclusions\nWe present a standardized methodology to analyze the NIS, systematically review the state of the NIS neurosurgical literature, suggest potential future directions for neurosurgical big data inquiries, and outline recommendations to improve the design of future neurosurgical data instruments.","Oliver Y.

Therefore, many firms defer collecting and integrating big data as they have concerns regarding the impact of utilizing big data on data diagnosticity (i.e., retrieval of valuable information from data) and firm decision making quality. In this study, we use the Organizational Learning Theory and Wang and Strong's data quality framework to explore the impact of processing big data on firm decision quality and the mediating role of data quality (DQ) and data diagnosticity on this relationship. We validate the proposed research model using survey data from 130 firms, obtained from data analysts and IT managers. Results confirm the critical role of DQ in increasing data diagnosticity and improving firm decision quality when processing big data; suggesting important implications for practice and theory. Findings also reveal that while big data utilization positively impacts contextual DQ, accessibility DQ, and representational DQ, interestingly, it negatively impacts intrinsic DQ.

Daily gap-free aerosol fine mode fraction (FMF) data were first derived via a data-driven regression model based on remote sensing big data. According to empirically determined FMF probability distributions over regions with typical emission sources, aerosols in China were classified into eight major types, including typical\/atypical\/mixed anthropogenic aerosols, typical\/atypical\/mixed dust, and typical mixed and multiple modes. The results indicated that the gridded FMF estimates derived in this study agreed well with FMF retrievals from AERONET, with correlation coefficient of 0.81 and root mean square error of 0.13. The long-term variations in major aerosol types showed that in China the territory covered by typical anthropogenic aerosols was reduced from 21.38% to 11.76% over the past two decades, while dust aerosols decreased from 6.99% to 2.15%. The declining trend in anthropogenic aerosols could be attributed to reduced coal consumption and\/or favorable dispersion conditions, whereas decreasing dust aerosols were largely associated with increased vegetation cover and\/or weakened wind speed in the west.

In such a scenario, methods and techniques for the Data Quality assessment can support the identification of suitable data to process. If for traditional database numerous assessment methods are proposed, in the Big Data scenario new algorithms have to be designed in order to deal with novel requirements related to variety, volume and velocity issues.

Furthermore, we show that in some situations it is not possible to evaluate the quality of the entire dataset due to performance and time constraints. For this reason, we suggest to focus the Data Quality assessment only on a portion of the dataset and to take into account the consequent loss of accuracy by introducing a confidence factor as a measure of the reliability of the quality assessment procedure.

However, these \u201cbig\u201d data have their limitations. Best practice requires clinicians, informaticians, and data scientists to work together, so assumptions over data quality or validity are not misplaced. This chapter explains why the evidence base for child and adolescent mental healthcare needs big data applications as well as conventional research, to move the field forward. This chapter provides illustrations of big data applications to child and adolescent mental healthcare, primarily from England and the United Kingdom, but also offers a section on the global perspective. This chapter also reviews the methodological strengths and weaknesses of big data and describes the ethical and governance implications for their use.","Alice Wickersham and Johnny Downs","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/B978-0-323-91709-4.00005-6","2023","Chapter 3 - Clinical applications of big data to child and adolescent mental health care"],["The period of Big Data examination has started in many businesses inside created nations.

BDNi data were statistically deconvoluted by the Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) to discern mechanically distinct phases and their Young\u2019s moduli and hardness at the micro\/nano scale and the bulk composites\u2019 properties at the macro scale. Results show that the SBL emulsion can be more homogeneously dispersed into the cement matrix, due to its emulsified soft consistency and hydrophilicity, resulting in the formation of soft coatings on, and softer infills intermixed with, the cement hydration products (CHPs). In contrast, the two hydrophobic, inert, particulate elastomers, PP and NR powders, only act as isolated soft inclusions embedded in the hydrated cement matrix. The NR melts at high temperatures and permeates into the pores of the cement matrix, leading to the formation of complex intervened micromorphology and hence functions better than the PP. All elastomers can effectively reduce the composites\u2019 Young\u2019s moduli: with increasing the elastomer contents, while the modulus of a BDNi-identified major CHP phase decreases from 20.9 to 11.3 GPa, the bulk composites\u2019 counterpart from 17.3 to 10.7 GPa.

Modeling and collaborating the key scenario information required for GBDG decision-making can minimize system uncertainties. However, existing scenario-building methods are limited by their rigidity as they are employed in various application contexts and the associated high costs of modeling. In this paper, using a design science paradigm, a model-driven scenario modeling approach is proposed to achieve flexible scenario modeling for various applications through the transfer of generic domain knowledge. The key component of the proposed approach is a scenario meta-model that is built from existing literatures and practices by integrating qualitative, quantitative, and meta-modeling analysis. An instantiation mechanism of the scenario meta-model is also proposed to generate customized scenarios under Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) theory. Two real-world safety service cases in Wuhan, China were evaluated to find that the proposed approach reduces GBDG decision-making uncertainties significantly by providing key information for GBDG problem identification, solution design, and solution value perception.

Many low-tech firms engage in these data policies to improve their decisions and performance through the predictive capacities of their data. A discussion emerges in the literature according to which an effective policy lies in the conversion of a mass of raw data into so-called intelligent data. In order to understand better this digital transition, we question the transformation of data policies practiced in low-tech firms through the founding model of 3Vs (Volume, Variety and Velocity of data). First of all, this empirical study of 112 French automotive distributors develops the existing literature by proposing an original and detailed typology of the data policies practiced (Low data, Big data and Smart data). Secondly, after specifying the elements of the differences between the quantitative nature of Big data and the qualitative nature of Smart data, our results reveal and analyse for the first time the existence of their synergistic relationship. Companies transform their Big data approach into Smart data when they move from massive exploitation to intelligent exploitation of their data. The phenomenon is part of a high-end loop data exploitation. Initially, the exploitation of intelligent data can only be done by extracting a sample from a large raw data pool previously made by a Big data policy. Secondly, the organization's raw data pool is in turn enriched by the repayment of contributions made by the Smart data approach. Thus, this study develops three important ways. First off, we identify, detail and compare the current data policies of a traditional industry.

And since IoT is considered to be a massive quantity of heterogeneous networked embedded devices that generate big data, then it is very complex to compute and analyze such massive data. So this paper introduces a new model named NRDD-DBSCAN based on DBSCAN algorithm and using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) to detect outliers that affect the data quality of IoT technologies. NRDD-DBSCAN has been applied on three different datasets of N-dimensions (2-D, 3-D, and 25-D) and the results were promising. Finally, comparisons have been made between NRDD-DBSCAN and previous models such as RDD-DBSCAN model and DBSCAN algorithm, and these comparisons proved that NRDD-DBSCAN solved the low dimensionality issue of RDD-DBSCAN model and also solved the fact that DBSCAN algorithm cannot handle IoT data. So the conclusion is that NRDD-DBSCAN proposed model can detect the outliers that exist in the datasets of N-dimensions by using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), and NRDD-DBSCAN can enhance the quality of data exists in IoT applications and technologies.","Haitham Ghallab and Hanan Fahmy and Mona Nasr","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.eij.2019.12.001","2020","Detection outliers on internet of things using big data technology"],["With the upsurge of data traffic due to the change in customer behavior towards the use of telecommunications services, fostered by the current global health situation (mainly due to Covid-19), the telecommunications operators have a golden opportunity to create new sources of revenues using Big Data Analytics (BDA) solutions.

Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.","Lingqiang Kong and Zhifeng Liu and Jianguo Wu","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jclepro.2020.123142","2020","A systematic review of big data-based urban sustainability research: State-of-the-science and future directions"],["Data quality (DQ) assessment is essential for realizing the promise of big data by judging the value of data in advance. Relevance, an indispensable dimension of DQ, focusing on \u201cfitness for requirement\u201d, can arouse the user\u2019s interest in exploiting the data source. It has two-level evaluations: (1) the amount of data that meets the user\u2019s requirements; (2) the matching degree of these relevant data. However, there lack works of DQ assessment at dimension of relevance, especially for unstructured image data which focus on semantic similarity. When we try to evaluate semantic relevance between an image data source and a query (requirement), there are three challenges: (1) how to extract semantic information with generalization ability for all image data? (2) how to quantify relevance by fusing the quantity of relevant data and the degree of similarity comprehensively? (3) how to improve assessing efficiency of relevance in a big data scenario by design of an effective architecture? To overcome these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware data quality assessment (SDQA) architecture which includes off-line analysis and on-line assessment. In off-line analysis, for an image data source, we first transform all images into hash codes using our improved Deep Self-taught Hashing (IDSTH) algorithm which can extract semantic features with generalization ability, then construct a graph using hash codes and restricted Hamming distance, next use our designed Semantic Hash Ranking (SHR) algorithm to calculate the importance score (rank) for each node (image), which takes both the quantity of relevant images and the degree of semantic similarity into consideration, and finally rank all images in descending order of score. During on-line assessment, we first convert the user\u2019s query into hash codes using IDSTH model, then retrieve matched images to collate their importance scores, and finally help the user determine whether the image data source is fit for his requirement. The results on public dataset and real-world dataset show effectiveness, superiority and on-line efficiency of our SDQA architecture.","Yu Liu and Yangtao Wang and Ke Zhou and Yujuan Yang and Yifei Liu","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2019.07.063","2020","Semantic-aware data quality assessment for image big data"],["Big data initiatives are critical for transforming traditional organizational decision making into data-driven decision making.

The formation and evolution of chondrules and matrix and, in particular, the mechanics of chondrule formation remain the biggest unsolved challenge in meteoritics. A large number of studies of these major components not only helped to understand these in ever greater detail, but also produced a remarkably large body of data. Studying all available data has become known as \u2039big data\u203a analyses and promises deep insights \u2013 in this case \u2013 to chondrule and matrix formation and relationships. Looking at all data may also allow one to better understand the mechanism of chondrule formation or, equally important, what information we might be missing to identify this process. A database of all available chondrule and matrix data further provides an overview and quick visualisation, which will not only help to solve actual problems, but also enable students and future researchers to quickly access and understand all we know about these components. We collected all available data on elemental bulk chondrule and matrix compositions in a database that we call ChondriteDB. The database also contains petrographic and petrologic information on chondrules. Currently, ChondriteDB contains about 2388 chondrule and 1064 matrix data from 70 different publications and 161 different chondrites. Future iterations of ChondriteDB will include isotope data and information on other chondrite components. Data quality is of critical importance. However, as we discuss, quality is not an objective category, but a subjective judgement. Quantifiable data acquisition categories are required that allow selecting the appropriate data from a database in the context of a given research problem.

There is a great necessity to integrate the small data measured in different tasks and build the process model by sharing the information.

Today\u2019s way of working with standards is characterized by manual viewing of documents, whereby a user searches for relevant information, such as formulas, and has to transfer this information to his process, method or tool. This manual process results in an increased time, loss of quality due to faulty manual transmission of information, a high adjustment effort for updates of standards and no guarantee for traceability. In order to reduce and minimize errors and needed time for work with information stored within standards, there is a need for a new form of knowledge representation for standards with sufficient data quality to ensure standard-compliant development activities. Consequently, there is a need for machine-actionable standards to ensure autonomous and efficient processes, whereby the effort for preparation is less than the benefit.

A potential alternative for producing lexicons and analyzing the sensory attributes of products in nonstandardized text can be found in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The wheel is compared to an existing Scotch flavor wheel. The ease of collecting nonstandardized descriptions of products and the improved speed of automated methods can facilitate collection of descriptive sensory data for products where no lexicon exists.

Results: For each considered use-case, we outline the type of questions posed by domain experts, data involved in addressing these questions, and describe the specific image-based techniques we used to address these questions. Further, for each of the proposed techniques, we describe the visual representation and interaction mechanisms that have been used to address the above-mentioned goals.

Data integration with secure record linkage, privacy preservation, quality control, and data standardization are the main challenges for developing a consistent and interoperable centralized clinical data repository.

A prototype of NCDW has been developed with a complete pipeline from data collection to analytics by integrating three data sources. The proposed NCDW model facilitates regional and national decision support, intelligent disease analysis, knowledge discovery, and data-driven research.

Meanwhile, the amount of real-time monitoring and control data in BASs grows continually in the building lifecycle, which stimulates an intense demand for powerful big data analysis tools in BASs. Existing big data analytics adopted in the building automation industry focus on mining cross-sectional relationships, whereas the temporal relationships, i.e., the relationships over time, are usually overlooked. However, building operations are typically dynamic and BAS data are essentially multivariate time series data. This paper presents a time series data mining methodology for temporal knowledge discovery in big BAS data. A number of time series data mining techniques are explored and carefully assembled, including the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif discovery, and temporal association rule mining. This study also develops two methods for the efficient post-processing of knowledge discovered. The methodology has been applied to analyze the BAS data retrieved from a real building. The temporal knowledge discovered is valuable to identify dynamics, patterns and anomalies in building operations, derive temporal association rules within and between subsystems, assess building system performance and spot opportunities in energy conservation.","Cheng Fan and Fu Xiao and Henrik Madsen and Dan Wang","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.enbuild.2015.09.060","2015","Temporal knowledge discovery in big BAS data for building energy management"],["The proliferation of urban sensing, IoT, and big data in cities provides unprecedented opportunities for a deeper understanding of occupant behaviour and energy usage patterns at the urban scale.

Whilst an understanding of marine debris risks is steadily advancing, monitoring at spatial and temporal scales relevant to management remains limited. Citizen science projects address this shortcoming but are often critiqued on data accuracy and potential bias in sampling efforts. Here we present 10-years of Australia's largest marine debris database - the Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI), in which we perform systematic data filtering, test for differences between collecting groups, and report patterns in marine debris. We defined five stages of data filtering to address issues in data quality and to limit inference to ocean-facing sandy beaches. Significant differences were observed in the average accumulation of items between filtered and remaining data. Further, differences in sampling were compared between collecting groups at the same site (e.g., government, NGOs, and schools), where no significant differences were observed. The filtering process removed 21% of events due to data quality issues and a further 42% of events to restrict analyses to ocean-facing sandy beaches. The remaining 7275 events across 852 sites allowed for an assessment of debris patterns at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Hard plastics were the most common material found on beaches both nationally and regionally, consisting of up to 75% of total debris. Nationally, land and sea-sourced items accounted for 48% and 7% of debris, respectively, with most debris found on the east coast of Australia. This study demonstrates the value of citizen science datasets with broad spatial and temporal coverage, and the importance of data filtering to improve data quality.

The model explains the effects of clicking position (e.g., on a review webpage's serial list) and the number of items per webpage on posting contributions. Reading reviews from the last webpage only, or from the first webpage and last webpage simultaneously, can promote a greater review volume than reading reviews in other positions. This illustrates that representing primacy (first items) and recency (recent items) within one page simultaneously, or displaying recent items in reverse chronological order, are relatively better strategies for the webpage display of online reviews. The number of items plays a nonlinear moderating role in bridging the clicking position and posting behavior, and we determine the optimal number of items.

In this paper, we propose an overarching framework outlining five major challenges to personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, and respective methodologies in an integrated interdisciplinary manner. First, urban air quality data is sparse, rendering it difficult to provide timely personalized alert and advice. Second, collected data, especially those involving human inputs such as health perception, are often missing and erroneous. Third, the data collected are heterogeneous, and highly complex, not easily comprehensible to facilitate individual and collective decision-making. Fourth, the causal relationships between personal air pollutants exposure (specifically, PM2.5 and PM1.0 and NO2) and personal health conditions, and health-related quality of life perception, of young asthmatics and young healthy citizens in Hong Kong (HK), are yet to be established. Fifth, whether personalized and smart information and advice provided can induce behavioural change and improve health and quality of life are yet to be determined. To overcome these challenges, our first novelty is to develop an AI and big data framework to estimate and forecast air quality in high temporal-spatial resolution and real-time. Our second novelty includes the deployment of mobile pollution sensor platforms to substantially improve the accuracy of estimated and forecasted air quality data, and the collection of activity, health condition and perception data. Our third novelty is the development of visualization tools and comprehensible indexes, by correlating personal exposure with four types of personal data, to provide timely, personalized pollution, health and travel alerts and advice. Our fourth novelty is determining causal relationship, if any, between personal pollutants, PM1.0 and PM2.5, NO2 exposure and personal health condition, and personal health perception, based on a clinical experiment of 150 young asthmatics and 150 young healthy citizens in HK. Our fifth novelty is an intervention study to determine if smart information, presented via our proposed visualized platform, will induce personal behavioural change.

The collaboration is set up by sharing their resources, capabilities, competencies, and information to imitate a unique organisation. The objective is to increase internal value to their shareholders (where value is seen as wealth) and deliver better external value to the end-customer (where value represents customer satisfaction).

Hence, accurate estimates of air pollutant emissions of these fast-changing LDGVs are vital for air quality management, human healthcare, and ecological protection. However, this issue is poorly quantified due to insufficient reserves of timely updated LDGV emission factors, which are dependent on real-world activity levels. Here we constructed a big dataset of explicit emission profiles (e.g., emission factors and accumulated mileages) for 159,051 LDGVs based on an official I\/M database by matching real-time traffic dynamics via real-world traffic monitoring (e.g., traffic volumes and speeds). Consequently, we provide robust evidence that the emission factors of these LDGVs follow a clear heavy-tailed distribution. The top 10 % emitters contributed >60 % to the total fleet emissions, while the bottom 50 % contributed <10 %.

The literature indicates that big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence has the ability to enhance supply chain performance, but there is limited research concerning the reasons for which firms engaging in manufacturing activities adopt big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence. To address this gap, our study employs institutional theory and resource-based view theory to elucidate the way in which automotive firms configure tangible resources and workforce skills to drive technological enablement and improve sustainable manufacturing practices and furthermore develop circular economy capabilities. We tested the research hypothesis using primary data collected from 219 automotive and allied manufacturing companies operating in South Africa. The contribution of this work lies in the statistical validation of the theoretical framework, which provides insight regarding the role of institutional pressures on resources and their effects on the adoption of big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence, and how this affects sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities under the moderating effects of organizational flexibility and industry dynamism.","Surajit Bag and Jan Ham Christiaan Pretorius and Shivam Gupta and Yogesh K.

Security risks in Big Data must be analyzed and managed in an appropriate manner to protect the system and secure the information and the data being handled.

Both MARISMA and eMARISMA are specifically designed to be easily adapted to particular contexts, such as Big Data.

Different issues have ascended in the area of Big data security such as infrastructure security, data privacy, data management and data integrity. Currently, Big data processing, analytics and storage is secured using cryptography algorithms, which are not appropriate for Big data protection over Cloud. In this paper, we present a solution for addressing the main issues in Big data security over Cloud. We propose a novel system architecture called the Secure Authentication and Data Sharing in Cloud (SADS-Cloud). There are three processes involved in this paper including (i). Big Data Outsourcing, (ii). Big Data Sharing and (iii). Big Data Management. In Big data outsourcing, the data owners are registered to a Trust Center using SHA-3 hashing algorithm. The MapReduce model is used to split the input file into fixed-size of blocks of data and SALSA20 encryption algorithm is applied over each block. In Big data sharing, data users participate in a secure file retrieval. For this purpose, user's credentials (ID, password, secure ID, and current timestamp, email id) are hashed and compared with that stored in a database. In Big data management, there are three important processes implemented to organize data. They are as follows: Compression using Lemperl Ziv Markow Algorithm (LZMA), Clustering using Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Indexing using Fractal Index Tree. The proposed scheme for these processes are implemented using Java Programming and performance tested for the following metrics: Information Loss, Compression Ratio, Throughput, Encryption Time and Decryption Time.","Uma Narayanan and Varghese Paul and Shelbi Joseph","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jksuci.2020.05.005","2022","A novel system architecture for secure authentication and data sharing in cloud enabled Big Data Environment"],["Medical artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technical asset to support medical supply-side reforms and national development in the big data era.

Subjective conventional methods have been applied frequently in past decades. However, due to increasingly complex product and supply chain structures, diverse working conditions, and massive amounts of components, accuracy and efficiency of root cause analysis are progressively challenged in practice. Therefore, data-driven root cause analysis methods have attracted attention lately. In this paper, taking advantage of the availability of big operations data and the rapid development of data science, we design a big data-driven root cause analysis system utilizing Machine Learning techniques to improve the performance of root cause analysis. More specifically, we first propose a conceptual framework of the big data-driven root cause analysis system including three modules of Problem Identification, Root Cause Identification, and Permanent Corrective Action. Furthermore, in the Problem Identification Module, we construct a unified feature-based approach to describe multiple and different types of quality problems by applying a data mining method. In the Root Cause Identification Module, we use supervised Machine Learning (classification) methods to automatically predict the root causes of multiple quality problems. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system and algorithms based on actual quality data from a case company.

In Industry 4.0, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Wireless Sensors (WSs) in the manufacturing processes, such as equipment, machining, assembly, material handling, inspection, etc., generates a huge volume of data known as Industrial Big Data (IBD). However, the reliable and efficient gathering and transmission of this big data from the source sensors to the floor inspection system for the real-time monitoring of unexpected changes in the production and quality control processes is the biggest challenge for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs). This is because of the harsh nature of the indoor industrial environment that causes high noise, signal fading, multipath effects, heat and electromagnetic interference, which reduces the transmission quality and trigger errors in the IWSNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel cross-layer data gathering approach called CBI4.0 for active monitoring and control of manufacturing processes in the Industry 4.0. The key aim of the proposed CBI4.0 scheme is to exploit the multi-channel and multi-radio architecture of the sensor network to guarantee quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as higher data rates, throughput, and low packet loss, corrupted packets, and latency by dynamically switching between different frequency bands in the Multichannel Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs). By performing several simulation experiments through EstiNet 9.0 simulator, the performance of the proposed CBI4.0 scheme is compared against existing studies in the automobile Industry 4.0. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes and is suitable for effective control and monitoring of various events in the automobile Industry 4.0.","Muhammad Faheem and Rizwan Aslam Butt and Rashid Ali and Basit Raza and Md.

This scenario is deeply changing the security landscape, introducing new risks and threats that affect security and privacy of systems, on one side, and safety of users, on the other side. Many domains that can benefit from novel solutions based on data analytics have stringent security requirements to fulfill. The Energy domain\u2019s Smart Grid is a major example of systems at the crossroads of security and data-driven intelligence. The Smart Grid plays a crucial role in modern energy infrastructure. However, it must face two major challenges related to security: managing front-end intelligent devices such as power assets and smart meters securely, and protecting the huge amount of data received from these devices. Starting from these considerations, setting up proper analytics is a complex problem because security controls could have the undesired side effect of decreasing the accuracy of the analytics themselves. This is even more critical when the configuration of security controls is let to the security expert, who often has only basic skills in data science.

To meet users' complex and heterogeneous needs in the era of big data, service reuse is a natural and efficient means that helps orchestrating available services' operations, to provide customer on-demand big services. However different from traditional Web service composition, composing big services refers to the reuse of, not only existing high-quality services, but also high-quality data sources, while taking into account their security constraints (e.g., data provenance, threat level and data leakage). Moreover, composing heterogeneous and large-scale data-centric services faces several challenges, apart from security risks, such as the big services' high execution time and the incompatibility between providers' policies across multiple domains and clouds. Aiming to solve the above issues, we propose a scalable approach for big service composition, which considers not only the quality of reused services (QoS), but also the quality of their consumed data sources (QoD). Since the correct representation of big services requirements is the first step towards an effective composition, we first propose a quality model for big services and we quantify the data breaches using L-Severity metrics. Then to facilitate processing and mining big services' related information during composition, we exploit the strong mathematical foundation of fuzzy Relational Concept Analysis (fuzzy RCA) to build the big services' repository as a lattice family. We also used fuzzy RCA to cluster services and data sources based on various criteria, including their quality levels, their domains, and the relationships between them. Finally, we define algorithms that parse the lattice family to select and compose high-quality and secure big services in a parallel fashion.

On the other hand, real-time monitoring produces large amounts of data, leading to significant challenges for efficient and effective data transmission (from the shop floor to the cloud) and analysis (in the cloud). Restricted by industrial hardware capability, especially Internet bandwidth, most solutions approach data transmission from the perspective of data compression (before transmission, at local computing devices) coupled with data reconstruction (after transmission, in the cloud). However, existing data compression techniques may not adapt to domain-specific characteristics of data, and hence have limitations in addressing high compression ratios where full restoration of signal details is important for revealing machine conditions. This study integrates Deep Convolutional Autoencoders (DCAE) with local structure and physics-informed loss terms that incorporate PHM domain knowledge such as the importance of frequency content for machine fault diagnosis. Furthermore, Fault Division Autoencoder Multiplexing (FDAM) is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of multiple disjoint operating conditions on reconstruction fidelity. The proposed methods are evaluated on two case studies, and autocorrelation-based noise analysis provides insight into the relative performance across machine health and operating conditions. Results indicate that physically-informed DCAE compression outperforms prevalent data compression approaches, such as compressed sensing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and DCAE with a standard loss function. FDAM can further improve the data reconstruction quality for certain machine conditions.","Matthew Russell and Peng Wang","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ymssp.2021.108709","2022","Physics-informed deep learning for signal compression and reconstruction of big data in industrial condition monitoring"],["Zusammenfassung\nHintergrund\nIn Deutschland leben etwa 4 Millionen Menschen mit einer seltenen Erkrankung.

Studies have shown that big data applications can improve diagnosis of and research on rare diseases more effectively. However, no concrete comprehensive concept for the use of big data in the care of people with rare diseases has so far been established in Germany. As part of the project \u201cBIDA-SE\u201d, which is funded by the German Ministry of Health, a first scenario has been designed to show how big data applications can be usefully incorporated into the care of people with rare diseases.\nMethods\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate this scenario with regard to acceptance, (clinical) benefits, economic aspects, and limitations and barriers to its implementation. To evaluate the scenario, an online survey was conducted in Germany in October\/November 2019 amongst a total of N\u00a0=\u00a09 physicians, N\u00a0=\u00a069 patients with rare diseases\/patient representatives, N\u00a0=\u00a014 IT experts and N\u00a0=\u00a021 health care researchers. The online questionnaire consisted of both standardized, validated questions taken from already tested survey instruments and additional questions which were constructed on the basis of a preceding literature analysis. The evaluation of the survey was primarily descriptive, with a calculation of frequencies, mean values and standard deviations.\nResults\nThe results of the evaluation show that the scenario has been accepted by a majority of all groups surveyed (physicians, patients\/patient representatives, IT experts and health care researchers). From the point of view of physicians, patients\/patient representatives and health care researchers, the scenario has the potential to accelerate the diagnosis and initiation of therapy and to improve cross-sectoral treatment. From the physician\u2019s and health care researcher\u2019s perspective, investments in the application presented in the scenario would be profitable. Financing the scenario would, however, require adjusting the reimbursement situation. The limitations and barriers identified by all groups for a medium-term implementation of the scenario can be grouped into seven thematic areas where action is needed: (1) financing and investment, (2) data protection and data security, (3) standards\/data sources\/data quality, (4) acceptance of technology, (5) integration into the daily work routine, (6) knowledge about availability as well as (7) habits and preferences\/physician's role.\nDiscussion\nWith the present study, a first interdisciplinary, practical scenario using big data applications was evaluated with regard to acceptance, benefits and limitations\/barriers. The scenario is widely accepted among the majority of all surveyed target groups and is considered (clinically) useful, although legal, organisational and technical barriers still need to be overcome for its medium-term implementation. The evaluation results contribute to the derivation of recommendations for action to ensure the medium-term implementation of the scenario and to channel access to the Centres for Rare Diseases in the future.\nConclusion\nMany activities have been initiated at a national level to improve the health care situation of people with rare diseases. The scenario developed in the \u201cBIDA-SE\u201d project complements these research activities and illustrates how big data applications can be usefully implemented into practice to improve the diagnosis and therapy of people with rare diseases in a sustainable way.","Brita Sedlmayr and Andreas Knapp and Mich\u00e9le K\u00fcmmel and Franziska Bathelt and Martin Sedlmayr","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.zefq.2020.11.002","2020","Evaluation eines Zukunftsszenarios zur Nutzung von Big-Data-Anwendungen f\u00fcr die Verbesserung der Versorgung von Menschen mit seltenen Erkrankungen"],["This is the first systematic literature review concerning the interconnections between big data (BD) and co-innovation.

Simply assuming that all buildings with the same structural type follow an identical life span can cause serious estimation errors. In this study, we collected 1,812,700 records describing buildings built and demolished in South Korea, analysed the actual life span of each building, and developed a building life-span prediction model using deep-learning and traditional machine learning. The prediction models examined in this study produced root mean square errors of 3.72\u20134.6 and the coefficients of determination of 0.932\u20130.955. Among those models, a deep-learning based prediction model was found the most powerful. As anticipated, the conventional method of determining a building's life expectancy using a discrete set of specific factors and associated assumptions of life span did not yield realistic results.

Many natural cities beyond central cities contribute to polycentric development at the metropolitan level.

Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework.","Ali Al-Badi and Ali Tarhini and Asharul Islam Khan","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.procs.2018.10.181","2018","Exploring Big Data Governance Frameworks"],["Operating modern multi-modal surface transportation systems are becoming increasingly automated and driven by decision support systems. One aspect necessary for successful, safe, reliable, and efficient operation of any transportation network is real-time and forecasted weather and pavement condition information. Providing such information requires an adaptive system capable of blending large amounts of observational and model data that arrives quickly, in disparate formats and times, and blends and optimizes their use via expert systems and machine-learning algorithms. Quality control of the data is also essential, and historical data is required to both develop expert-based empirical algorithms and train machine learning models. This paper reports on the open-source Pikalert\u00ae system that brings together weather information and real-time data from connected vehicles to provide crucial information to enhance the safety and efficiency of surface transportation systems. This robust framework can be applied to a diverse array of user community specifications and is designed to rapidly ingest more, unique data sets as they become available. Ultimately, the developmental framework of this system will provide critical environmental information necessary to promote the development, growth, refinement, and expanded adoption of automated and connected multi-modal vehicular systems globally.","Amanda R.

This paper developed a perception approach of surrounding rock class based on TBM operational big data and combined unsupervised-supervised learning. In data preprocessing, four data mining techniques (i.e., Z-score, K-NN, Kalman filtering, and wavelet packet decomposition) were used to detect outliers, substitute outliers, suppress noise, and extract features, respectively. Then, GMM was used to revise the original surrounding rock class through clustering TBM load parameters and performance parameters in view of the shortcomings of the HC method in the TBM-excavated tunnel. After that, five various ensemble learning classification models were constructed to identify the surrounding rock class, in which model hyper-parameters were automatically tuned by Bayes optimization. In order to evaluate model performance, balanced accuracy, Kappa, F1-score, and training time were taken into account, and a novel multi-metric comprehensive ranking system was designed. Engineering application results indicated that LightGBM achieved the most superior performance with the highest comprehensive score of 6.9066, followed by GBDT (5.9228), XGBoost (5.4964), RF (3.7581), and AdaBoost (0.9946). Through the weighted purity reduction algorithm, the contributions of input features on the five models were quantitatively analyzed.

Due to a large number of data sources, data source selection plays a crucial role in information integration, since it is costly and even impossible to access all data sources. Data Source selection should consider both efficiency and effectiveness issues. For efficiency, the approach should scale to large data source amount. From effectiveness aspect, data quality and overlapping of sources are to be considered. In this paper, we study source selection problem in Big Data and propose methods which can scale to datasets with up to millions of data sources and guarantee the quality of results. Motivated by this, we propose a new metric taking the expected number of true values a source can provide as a criteria to evaluate the contribution of a data source. Based on our proposed index, we present a scalable algorithm and two pruning strategies to improve the efficiency without sacrificing precision. Experimental results on both real world and synthetic data sets show that our methods can select sources providing a large proportion of true values efficiently and can scale to massive data sources.","Yiming Lin and Hongzhi Wang and Jianzhong Li and Hong Gao","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ins.2018.11.029","2019","Data source selection for information integration in big data era"],["With the growing scale and complexity of city infrastructures, the need for data analysis and machine learning is becoming more and more prominent in the field of civil infrastructure sensing.

We question the impact of big data on decision-making, realizing that big data \u2013 including its new methods and functions \u2013 must inevitably encounter existing political and managerial institutions. By studying two illustrative cases of big data use processes, we explore how these two worlds meet. Specifically, we look at the interaction between data analysts and decision makers. In this we distinguish between a rational view and a political view, and between an information logic and a decision logic. We find that big data provides ample opportunities for both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn't necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents rather than as links in a functional chain.

The SUDS deploys geospatial technology, synthetic small area urban metrics, and cloud computing to enable urban analytics, and geovisualization with the goal of deriving actionable knowledge for better urban management and data-driven urban decision making. At the core of the system is a programme of urban indicators generated by using novel forms of data and urban modelling and simulation programme. SUDS differs from other similar systems by its emphasis on the generation and use of regularly updated spatially-activated urban area metrics from real or near-real time data sources, to enhance understanding of intra-city interactions and dynamics.

Consequently, to conduct meaningful and useful data quality evaluations, business rules must be first completely identified and captured at the beginning of the evaluation to perform sound measurements. We propose that the evaluation leads to better and more interpretable and useful results when the potential contribution of these business rules to the measurement of the data quality characteristics is first evaluated, avoiding the inclusion in the evaluation of those not having potential contribution and the resulting waste of resources. Considering this, we feel that for a better management of business rules for data quality evaluation, it makes sense to group all business rules having an important contribution to the evaluation of data quality characteristics, something that other business rules management methodologies have not covered yet. Through our experiences in conducting industrial projects of data quality evaluations we identified six problems when collecting and grouping the business rules. These problems make data quality evaluation processes less efficient and more costly. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology to systematically collect, group and validate the business rules to avoid or to alleviate these problems. For the sake of generalization, comparability, and reusability, we propose to do the grouping for data quality characteristics and properties defined in ISO\/IEC 25012 and ISO\/IEC 25024, respectively.

Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multi-objective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions.

In particular, a full-localized speciation profile dataset mapped to five chemical mechanisms was developed to promote the determination of VOC speciation, and two dynamic approaches based on big data were used to improve the estimation of ship emissions and open fire biomass burning (OFBB). Compared with previous emissions, more VOC emissions were classified as oxygenated volatile organic compound (OVOC) species, and their contributions to the total ozone formation potential (OFP) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region increased by 17%. Formaldehyde became the largest OFP species in GD, accounting for 11.6% of the total OFP, indicating that the model-ready emission inventory developed in this study is more reactive. The high spatial-temporal variability of ship sources and OFBB, which were previously underestimated, was also captured by using big data. Ship emissions during typhoon days and holidays decreased by 23\u201355%. 95% of OFBB emissions were concentrated in 9% of the GD area and 31% of the days in 2017, demonstrating their strong spatial-temporal variability. In addition, this study revealed that GD emissions have changed rapidly in recent years due to the leap-forward control measures implemented, and thus, they needed to be updated regularly. All of these updates led to a 5\u201317% decrease in the emission uncertainty for most pollutants. The results of this study provide a reference for how to reduce uncertainties in developing model-ready emission inventories.","Zhijiong Huang and Zhuangmin Zhong and Qinge Sha and Yuanqian Xu and Zhiwei Zhang and Lili Wu and Yuzheng Wang and Lihang Zhang and Xiaozhen Cui and MingShuang Tang and Bowen Shi and Chuanzeng Zheng and Zhen Li and Mingming Hu and Linlin Bi and Junyu Zheng and Min Yan","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.144535","2021","An updated model-ready emission inventory for Guangdong Province by incorporating big data and mapping onto multiple chemical mechanisms"],["With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data technologies have emerged as a critical data analytics tool to bring the knowledge within IoT infrastructures to better meet the purpose of the IoT systems and support critical decision making.

The literature argues that to leverage big data analytics and realize performance gains, firms must develop strong big data analytics capabilities. Nevertheless, most studies operate under the assumption that there is limited heterogeneity in the way firms build their big data analytics capabilities and that related resources are of similar importance regardless of context. This paper draws on complexity theory and investigates the configurations of resources and contextual factors that lead to performance gains from big data analytics investments. Our empirical investigation followed a mixed methods approach using survey data from 175 chief information officers and IT managers working in Greek firms, and three case studies to show that depending on the context, big data analytics resources differ in significance when considering performance gains. Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method on the quantitative data, we show that there are four different patterns of elements surrounding big data analytics that lead to high performance.

Hence, network security analytics has become an important area of concern and has gained intensive attention among researchers, off late, specifically in the domain of anomaly detection in network, which is considered crucial for network security. However, preliminary investigations have revealed that the existing approaches to detect anomalies in network are not effective enough, particularly to detect them in real time. The reason for the inefficacy of current approaches is mainly due the amassment of massive volumes of data though the connected devices. Therefore, it is crucial to propose a framework that effectively handles real time big data processing and detect anomalies in networks.

In this Viewpoint article I therefore present a critical analysis of a number of widely-held assumptions about data in general and big data in particular. Rather than being a referential, natural, foundational, objective and equal representation of the world, it will be argued, data are partial and contingent and are brought into being through situated practices of conceptualization, recording and use.

A distinction is made between \u201cdata in principle\u201d as they are recorded, and the \u201cdata in practice\u201d as they are used.

Averaged CEFs of six particulate and gaseous species (PM, OC, EC, NMHC, OVOCs, VOCs) were 5.92\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.28, 4.10\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.50, 0.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05, 22.54\u202f\u00b1\u202f20.48, 1.56\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.44, and 7.94\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.27\u202fg\/h normalized in every cook stove, respectively. A three-field CEF index containing activity and emission factor species was created to identify and further build a connection with cooking-related POI data. A total of 95,034 cooking point sources were extracted from Beijing, as a study city. In downtown areas, four POI types were overlapped in the central part of the city and radiated into eight distinct directions from south to north.

As a branch of scientific research, production safety management is also exploring methods to take advantage of big data. This research aims to provide a theoretical basis for promoting the application of big data in production safety management. First, four different types of production safety management paradigms were identified, namely small-data-based, static-oriented, interpretation-based and causal-oriented paradigm, and the challenges to these paradigms in the presence of big data were introduced. Second, the opportunities of employing big data in production safety management were identified from four aspects, including better predict the future production safety phenomena, promote production safety management highlight relevance, achieve the balance between deductive and inductive approaches and promote the interdisciplinary development of production safety management. Third, the paradigm shifting trend of production safety management was concluded, and the discipline foundation of the new paradigm was considered as the integration of data science, production management and safety science. Fourth, a new big-data-driven production safety management paradigm was developed, which consists of the logical line of production safety management, the macro-meso-micro data spectrum, the key big data analytics, and the four-dimensional morphology. At last, the strengths (e.g., supporting better-informed safety description, safety inquisition, safety prediction) and future research direction (e.g., theory research focuses on safety-related data mining\/capturing\/cleansing) of the new paradigm were discussed.

Individual farmers are collecting increasing amounts of data (\u2018big data\u2019), which can help monitor the process of sustainable intensification at local level. In this study, we build upon such data to quantify the magnitude and identify the biophysical and management determinants of on-farm yield gaps and water productivity for the main arable crops cultivated in the Netherlands. The analysis focused on ware, seed and starch potatoes, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley and covered the period 2015\u20132017. A crop modelling approach based on crop coefficients (kc) and daily weather data was used to estimate the potential yield (Yp), radiation intercepted and potential evapotranspiration (ETP) for each crop. Yield gaps were estimated to be ca. 10% of Yp for sugar beet, 25\u201330% of Yp for ware, seed and starch potato and spring barley, and 35\u201340% of Yp for spring onion and winter wheat. Variation in actual yields was associated with water availability in key periods of the growing season as well as with sowing and harvest dates. However, the R2 of the fitted regressions was rather low (20\u201349%). Current levels of crop water productivity ranged between 13\u202fkg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for spring barley, ca. 15 kg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for seed potato, spring onion and winter wheat, 23\u202fkg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for ware potato and ca. 25\u202fkg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for starch potato and sugar beet. These values are about half of their potential, but increasing actual water productivity further is restricted by rainfall amount and distribution. However, doing so should not be prioritized over reducing environmental impacts of these intensive cropping systems in the short-term and may require large investments from farm to regional levels in the long-term. Although these findings are most relevant to similar cropping systems in NW Europe, the underlying methods are generic and can be used to benchmark crop performance in other cropping systems.

These large scale classification problems lead to severe runtime performance challenges, so practitioners often resort to fast approximation techniques. However, the increase in classification speed comes at a cost, as approximations are lossy, mis-assigning classes relative to the original reference classification algorithm. To address this problem, we introduce a Lossless Pruned Naive Bayes (LPNB) classification algorithm tailored to real-world, big data applications with thousands of classes. LPNB achieves significant speed-ups by drawing on Information Retrieval (IR) techniques for efficient posting list traversal and pruning. We show empirically that LPNB can classify text up to eleven times faster than standard Naive Bayes on a real-world data set with 7205 classes, with larger gains extrapolated for larger taxonomies. In practice, the achieved acceleration is significant as it can greatly cut required computation time. In addition, it is lossless: the output is identical to standard Naive Bayes, in contrast to extant techniques such as hierarchical classification. The acceleration does not rely on the taxonomy structure, and it can be used for both hierarchical and flat taxonomies.","Nanfei Sun and Bingjun Sun and Jian (Denny) Lin and Michael Yu-Chi Wu","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bdr.2018.05.007","2018","Lossless Pruned Naive Bayes for Big Data Classifications"],["A cloud framework refers to the aggregation of components like development tools, middleware and database services, needed for cloud computing, which aids in developing, deploying and managing cloud based applications strenuously, consequently making it an efficacious paradigm for massive scaling of dynamically allocated resources and their complex computing.

Among them, the molecular-level advanced planning and scheduling system (MAPS) can realize the cost performance measurement under different production schemes for potential types of processable crude oil, which is conducive to more accurate selection of crude oil and prediction of crude oil properties. In addition, the whole process simulation can be used to understand the product quality changes under different crude oil blending schemes and different unit operating conditions, which is conducive to timely adjusting the product blending schemes according to economic benefits or ex-factory demands. The operation conditions of secondary units and even the properties of mixed crude oil can be deduced according to different product quality requirements. In the process of optimization, the Continuous Catalytic Reforming (CCR) unit in the refinery process, for example, introduces the application of large data analysis, including correlation analysis, single index detection, multidimensional data anomaly detection, and the parameters of the single objective optimization, a multi-objective parameter optimization analysis, unstructured data analysis, and forecast analysis based on material properties. Good practices in CCR units have also been extended to other oil refining and chemical units, such as Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and ethylene cracking. In terms of equipment preventive maintenance, it introduced how to integrated application of Internet of things, deep machine learning, knowledge map and other technology to build real-time and on-line distributed equipment health monitoring and early warning system, for early detection of equipment hidden danger, early warning, early treatment of providing effective means, guarantee equipment run healthy and stable for a long period of time, to reduce unplanned downtime losses. In particular, the establishment of equipment prediction model based on time series and AI can realize effective monitoring and early warning of equipment faults such as shaft displacement, shaft fracture, shell cracking, power overload, and prediction of equipment remaining life.","Wu Qing","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/B978-0-12-820714-7.00009-1","2021","Chapter 9 - Global Practice of AI and Big Data in Oil and Gas Industry"],["This paper investigates big data analytics research and application in supply chain management between 2010 and 2016 and provides insights to industries.

To tackle these two research questions, we conducted a two-year pattern analysis with 2+ million user access records.

This growing data has several applications: businesses can use it to give a more personalized touch to their services, governments can use it to better allocate their funds, and companies can utilize it to select the best candidates for a job. While these applications may seem extremely enticing, there are a couple of problems that must be solved first, namely, data collection and extraction of useful patterns from the data. The disciplines of data mining and big data deal with these problems, respectively. But, as we have already discussed, the amount of data is so vast that any manual approach is extremely time intensive and costly. Thus this limits the potential outcomes from this data. This problem has been solved by the application of deep learning. Deep learning has allowed us to automate processes that were not only time intensive but also mentally arduous. It has achieved better than human accuracy in several types of discriminative and recognition tasks making it a viable alternative to inefficient human labor. Deep learning plays a vital role in this analysis and has enabled several businesses to comprehend customer needs and accordingly improve their own services, thus giving them the opportunity to outdo their competitors. Similarly, deep learning has also been instrumental in analyzing the trends and associations of securities in the financial market. It has even helped to create fraud detection and loan underwriting applications, which have contributed to making financial institutions more transparent and efficient. Apart from directly improving the efficiency in these fields, deep learning has also been instrumental in improving the fields of data mining and big data. Machine learning algorithms can actually utilize the existing data to predict the unknowns, including future trends in data. Due to its potential applications the field of machine learning is deeply interconnected with data mining. Nevertheless, machine learning algorithms are often heavily dependent on the availability of huge datasets to ensure useful accuracy. Deep learning algorithms have allowed the different components of data (i.e., multimedia data) in the data mining process itself to be identified. Similarly, semantic indexing and tagging algorithms have allowed the processes of big data to speed up.

In most industrialized countries, when a death occurs, it is a legal requirement that a medical certificate based on the international form recommended by World Health Organization's (WHO) is filled in by a physician. The physician reports the causes of death that directly led or contributed to the death on the death certificate. The death certificate is then forwarded to a coding office, where each cause is coded, and one underlying cause is defined, using the rules of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, now in its 10th Revision (ICD-10). Recently, a growing number of countries have adopted, or have decided to adopt, the coding software Iris, developed and maintained by an international consortium1. This whole standardized production process results in a high and constantly increasing international comparability of cause-specific mortality data. While these data could be used for international comparisons and benchmarking of global burden of diseases, quality of care and prevention policies, there are also many other ways and methods to explore their richness, especially when they are linked with other data sources. Some of these methods are potentially referring to the so-called \u201cbig data\u201d field. These methods could be applied both to the production of the data, to the statistical processing of the data, and even more to process these data linked to other databases.

On the contrary, the M2M platforms that handle Big Data might perform poorly or not according to the goals of their operator (in term of cost, database utilization, data quality, processing and computational efficiency, analysis and feature extraction applications). Therefore, to address the aforementioned needs, we propose a new effective, memory and processing efficient system architecture for Big Data in M2M, which, unlike other previous proposals, does not require whole set of data to be processed (including raw data sets), and to be kept in the main memory. Our designed system architecture exploits divide-and-conquer approach and data block-wise vertical representation of the database follows a particular petitionary strategy, which formalizes the problem of feature extraction applications. The architecture goes from physical objects to the processing servers, where Big Data set is first transformed into a several data blocks that can be quickly processed, then it classifies and reorganizes these data blocks from the same source. In addition, the data blocks are aggregated in a sequential manner based on a machine ID, and equally partitions the data using fusion algorithm. Finally, the results are stored in a server that helps the users in making decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system architecture are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core\u2122i5 machine with 3.2GHz processor and 4GB memory.

Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale, heterogeneous CPSs that utilise technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance, social media, and others to make informed decisions and drive the innovations of automation in urban areas. Such systems incorporate multiple layers and complex structure of hardware, software, analytical algorithms, business knowledge and communication networks, and operate under noisy and dynamic conditions. Thus, large-scale CPSs are vulnerable to enormous technical and operational challenges that may compromise the quality of data of their applications and accordingly reduce the quality of their services. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate data quality challenges in smart-cities large-scale CPSs and to identify the most common techniques used to address these challenges. This systematic literature review showed that significant work had been conducted to address data quality management challenges in smart cities, large-scale CPS applications. However, still, more is required to provide a practical, comprehensive data quality management solution to detect errors in sensor nodes\u2019 measurements associated with the main data quality dimensions of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and consistency.

One obstacle to translating NGS into routine health care has been a lack of clinical trials evaluating NGS technologies, which could be used to populate cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). A key question is whether big data can be used to partially support CEAs of NGS. This question has been brought into sharp focus with the creation of large national sequencing initiatives. In this article we summarize the main methodological and practical challenges of using big data as an input into CEAs of NGS. Our focus is on the challenges of using large observational datasets and cohort studies and linking these data to the genomic information obtained from NGS, as is being pursued in the conduct of large genomic sequencing initiatives. We propose potential solutions to these key challenges. We conclude that the use of genomic big data to support and inform CEAs of NGS technologies holds great promise.

This is particularly challenging for California, which has high variability in natural (e.g, wildfires, dust) and anthropogenic emissions, meteorology, topography (e.g. desert surfaces, mountains, snow cover) and land use.\nMethods\nUsing ensemble-based deep learning with big data fused from multiple sources we developed a PM2.5 prediction model with uncertainty estimates at a high spatial (1\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0km) and temporal (weekly) resolution for a 10-year time span (2008\u20132017). We leveraged autoencoder-based full residual deep networks to model complex nonlinear interrelationships among PM2.5 emission, transport and dispersion factors and other influential features. These included remote sensing data (MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD), normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface), MERRA-2 GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) output, wildfire smoke plume dispersion, meteorology, land cover, traffic, elevation, and spatiotemporal trends (geo-coordinates, temporal basis functions, time index). As one of the primary predictors of interest with substantial missing data in California related to bright surfaces, cloud cover and other known interferences, missing MAIAC AOD observations were imputed and adjusted for relative humidity and vertical distribution. Wildfire smoke contribution to PM2.5 was also calculated through HYSPLIT dispersion modeling of smoke emissions derived from MODIS fire radiative power using the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0 model.\nResults\nEnsemble deep learning to predict PM2.5 achieved an overall mean training RMSE of 1.54\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 (R2: 0.94) and test RMSE of 2.29\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 (R2: 0.87). The top predictors included M2GMI carbon monoxide mixing ratio in the bottom layer, temporal basis functions, spatial location, air temperature, MAIAC AOD, and PM2.5 sea salt mass concentration. In an independent test using three long-term AQS sites and one short-term non-AQS site, our model achieved a high correlation (>0.8) and a low RMSE (<3 \u03bcg\/m3). Statewide predictions indicated that our model can capture the spatial distribution and temporal peaks in wildfire-related PM2.5. The coefficient of variation indicated highest uncertainty over deciduous and mixed forests and open water land covers.\nConclusion\nOur method can be generalized to other regions, including those having a mix of major urban areas, deserts, intensive smoke events, snow cover and complex terrains, where PM2.5 has previously been challenging to predict. Prediction uncertainty estimates can also inform further model development and measurement error evaluations in exposure and health studies.","Lianfa Li and Mariam Girguis and Frederick Lurmann and Nathan Pavlovic and Crystal McClure and Meredith Franklin and Jun Wu and Luke D.

Global trade is highly dependent on shipping which covers around 90% of commercial demand. Now the industry is expected to navigate through many twists and turns of different situations like upcoming regulations, climate change, energy shortages and technological revolutions. Technological development is apparent across all marine sectors due to the rapid development of sensor technology, IT, automation and robotics. The industry must continue to develop at a rapid pace over the next decade in order to be able to adapt to upcoming regulations and market pressure. Ship intelligence will be the driving force shaping the future of the industry. Ships generate a large volume of data from different sources and in different formats. So big data has become the talk of the industry nowadays. Big data analysis discovers correlations between different measurable or unmeasurable parameters to determine hidden patterns and trends. This analysis will have a significant impact on vessel performance monitoring and provide performance prediction, real-time transparency, and decision-making support to the ship operator. Big data will also bring new opportunities and challenges for the maritime industry. It will increase the capability of performance monitoring, remove human error and increase interdependencies of components. However, the industry will have to face many challenges such as data processing, reliability, and data security. Many regulations rely on ship data including the new EU MRV (Monitoring, Reporting and Verification) regulation to quantify the CO2 emissions for ships above 5000 gross tonnage. As a result, ship operators will have to monitor and report the verified amount of CO2 emitted by their vessels on voyages to, from and between EU ports and will also be required to provide information on energy efficiency parameters. The MRV is a data-oriented regulation requiring ship operators to capture and monitor the ship emissions and other related data and although it is a regional regulation at the moment there is scope for the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to implement it globally in the near future.","Ibna Zaman and Kayvan Pazouki and Rose Norman and Shervin Younessi and Shirley Coleman","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.proeng.2017.08.182","2017","Challenges and Opportunities of Big Data Analytics for Upcoming Regulations and Future Transformation of the Shipping Industry"],["Value creation is a major sustainability factor for enterprises, in addition to profit maximization and revenue generation.

While it is used worldwide also in economies with lower production costs, services in manufacturing are slowly becoming commoditized and will become a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for reaching an above average competitive advantage. Consequently, in this article we propose a new basis for competitive advantage for manufacturing enterprises called a Big Data Strategy in servitization. We scrutinize how manufacturers can exploit the opportunity arising from combined Big Data and servitization. Therefore, the concept of a Big Data Strategy framework in servitization is proposed. The findings are benchmarked against established frameworks in the Big Data and servitization literature.

The main finding is that, through the proposed strategy, new revenue streams can be created, while opening the possibility to decrease prices for product\u2013services.

Moreover, the article discusses the novel solutions provided by the Guidelines with regard to the data subject's informed consent, the by-design approach, anonymization, and the role of the human factor in big data-supported decisions. This critical analysis of the Guidelines introduces a broader reflection on the divergent approaches of the Council of Europe and the European Union to regulating data processing. Where the principle-based model of the Council of Europe differs from the approach adopted by the EU legislator in the detailed Regulation (EU) 2016\/679. In the light of this, the provisions of the Guidelines and their attempt to address the major challenges of the new big data paradigm set the stage for concluding remarks about the most suitable regulatory model to deal with the different issues posed by the development of technology.","Alessandro Mantelero","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.clsr.2017.05.011","2017","Regulating big data.

We propose that the recommendation on the usability of the data be supported by a decision process, which includes a context-dependent data-quality assessment based on business rules. Ideally, this recommendation would be generated automatically. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) enables the assessment of data quality based on the evaluation of business rules, and also, provides stakeholders (e.g., data stewards) with sound support for the automation of the whole process of generation of a recommendation regarding usability based on data quality. The main contribution of the proposal involves designing and enabling both DMN-driven mechanisms and a guiding methodology (DMN4DQ) to support the automatic generation of a decision-based recommendation on the potential usability of a data record in terms of its level of data quality.

It is argued that, over time, changes to the nature of data may lead to significant differences in both modelling approaches and in the expectations placed upon them. Furthermore, it is suggested that the potential widespread availability of data to commercial actors and travellers will affect the performance of the transport systems themselves, which might be expected to have knock-on effects for planning functions.

To minimise such errors in advance, this paper presents a big data analytics based fault prediction approach for shop floor scheduling. Within the context, machining tasks, machining resources, and machining processes are represented by data attributes. Based on the available data on the shop floor, the potential fault\/error patterns, referring to machining errors, machine faults and maintenance states, are mined for unsuitable scheduling arrangements before machining as well as upcoming errors during machining. Comparing the data-represented tasks with the mined error patterns, their similarities or differences are calculated. Based on the calculated similarities, the fault probabilities of the scheduled tasks or the current machining tasks can be obtained, and they provide a reference of decision making for scheduling and rescheduling the tasks. By rescheduling high-risk tasks carefully, the potential errors can be avoided. In this paper, the architecture of the approach consisting of three steps in three levels is proposed. Furthermore, big data are considered in three levels, i.e. local data, local network data and cloud data. In order to implement this idea, several key techniques are illustrated in detail, e.g. data attribute, data cleansing, data integration of databases in different levels, and big data analytic algorithms.

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios.

The identification, characterization, and conservation of fungal diversity is paramount to preserving fungal bioresources, and to understanding and predicting ecosystem cycling and the evolution and epidemiology of fungal disease. Although species and ecosystem conservation are necessarily the foundation of preserving this diversity, there is value in expanding our definition of conservation to include the protection of biological collections, ecological metadata, genetic and genomic data, and the methods and code used for our analyses. These definitions of conservation are interdependent. For example, we need metadata on host specificity and biogeography to understand rarity and set priorities for conservation. To aid in these efforts, we need to draw expertise from diverse fields to tie traditional taxonomic knowledge to data obtained from modern -omics-based approaches, and support the advancement of diverse research perspectives. We also need new tools, including an updated framework for describing and tracking species known only from DNA, and the continued integration of functional predictions to link genetic diversity to functional and ecological diversity.

However, there is no obvious difference in fields of government and public services. Females possess stronger awareness but less skilled in precautions than males. Thirdly, people between the ages of 18 and 50 are more suspicious of data collected by enterprises, while age exerts little obvious influence on the credibility of data collected by the government, social associations and public services. Older people are less aware of precautions than people at other ages. In addition, from the perspective of education background, people with higher degrees possess stronger awareness of precautions and thus lower degree of trust. Therefore, it is suggested that more education on privacy consciousness should be given, and relative laws as well as regulations need improving. Besides, innovation in privacy protection technologies should be encouraged. What is more, we need to reinforce the management of the internet industry and strictly regulate personal data collection of the government.","Zhong Wang and Qian Yu","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.clsr.2015.08.006","2015","Privacy trust crisis of personal data in China in the era of Big Data: The survey and countermeasures"],["We introduce the Forward Observer system, which is designed to provide data assurance in field data acquisition while receiving significant amounts (several terabytes per flight) of Synthetic Aperture Radar data during flights over the polar regions, which provide unique requirements for developing data collection and processing systems.

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized\/proposed\/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on BD and BDA area.

This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns\/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes\/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database.

However, in some complex environments and unreachable regions of inconvenience for human, the establishment of the mobile sensing networks, the layout of the nodes and the control of the network topology to achieve high performance sensing of big data are increasingly becoming a main issue in the applications of the mobile sensing networks. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel on-demand coverage based self-deployment algorithm for big data perception based on mobile sensing networks in this paper. Firstly, by considering characteristics of mobile sensing nodes, we extend the cellular automata model and propose a new mobile cellular automata model for effectively characterizing the spatial\u2013temporal evolutionary process of nodes. Secondly, based on the learning automata theory and the historical information of node movement, we further explore a new mobile cellular learning automata model, in which nodes can self-adaptively and intelligently decide the best direction of movement with low energy consumption. Finally, we propose a new optimization algorithm which can quickly solve the node self-adaptive deployment problem, thus, we derive the best deployment scheme of nodes in a short time. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm in this paper outperforms the existing algorithms by as much as 40% in terms of the degree of satisfaction of network coverage, the iterations of the algorithm, the average moving steps of nodes and the energy consumption of nodes. Hence, we believe that our work will make contributions to large-scale adaptive deployment and high performance sensing scenarios of the mobile sensing networks.","Yaguang Lin and Xiaoming Wang and Fei Hao and Liang Wang and Lichen Zhang and Ruonan Zhao","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2018.01.007","2018","An on-demand coverage based self-deployment algorithm for big data perception in mobile sensing networks"],["Any given health system needs to increase efficiency and effectiveness up to the point of requiring a transformation of their current model to ensure their sustainability and continuity.

The application of AIS data has developed from simply navigation-oriented research to now include trade flow estimation, emission accounting, and vessel performance monitoring. The AIS now provides high frequency, real-time positioning and sailing patterns for almost the whole world's commercial fleet, and therefore, in combination with supplementary databases and analyses, AIS data has arguably kickstarted the era of digitisation in the shipping industry. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature regarding AIS applications by dividing it into three development stages, namely, basic application, extended application, and advanced application. Each stage contains two to three application fields, and in total we identified seven application fields, including (1) AIS data mining, (2) navigation safety, (3) ship behaviour analysis, (4) environmental evaluation, (5) trade analysis, (6) ship and port performance, and (7) Arctic shipping. We found that the original application of AIS data to navigation safety has, with the improvement of data accessibility, evolved into diverse applications in various directions. Moreover, we summarised the major methodologies in the literature into four categories, these being (1) data processing and mining, (2) index measurement, (3) causality analysis, and (4) operational research. Undoubtedly, the applications of AIS data will be further expanded in the foreseeable future. This will not only provide a more comprehensive understanding of voyage performance and allow researchers to examine shipping market dynamics from the micro level, but also the abundance of AIS data may also open up the rather opaque aspect of how shipping companies release information to external authorities, including the International Maritime Organization, port states, scientists and researchers. It is expected that more multi-disciplinary AIS studies will emerge in the coming years. We believe that this study will shed further light on the future development of AIS studies.","Dong Yang and Lingxiao Wu and Shuaian Wang and Haiying Jia and Kevin X.

We applied the widely endorsed nomenclature standard TG-263 as the mapping target and quantified the structure name inconsistency in 2 real-world data sets.\nMethods and Materials\nThe clinically relevant structures in the radiation therapy plans were identified by reference to randomized controlled trials. The Stature approach was used by clinicians to identify the synonyms for each relevant structure, which was then mapped to the corresponding TG-263 name. We applied Stature to standardize the structure names for 654 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and 224 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who received curative radiation therapy at our institution between 2007 and 2017. The accuracy of the Stature process was manually validated in a random sample from each cohort. For the HNSCC cohort we measured the resource requirements for Stature, and for the PCa cohort we demonstrated its impact on an example clinical analytics scenario.\nResults\nAll but 1 synonym group (\u201cHydrogel\u201d) was mapped to the corresponding TG-263 name, resulting in a TG-263 relabel rate of 99% (8837 of 8925 structures). For the PCa cohort, Stature matched a total of 5969 structures. Of these, 5682 structures were exact matches (ie, following local naming convention), 284 were matched via a synonym, and 3 required manual matching. This original radiation therapy structure names therefore had a naming inconsistency rate of 4.81%. For the HNSCC cohort, Stature mapped a total of 2956 structures (2638 exact, 304 synonym, 14 manual; 10.76% inconsistency rate) and required 7.5 clinician hours. The clinician hours required were one-fifth of those that would be required for manual relabeling.

However, most of them failed to consider the dynamic changes of population distribution adequately and were limited by the accuracy of PM2.5 estimations. Therefore, in this study, location-based service (LBS) data from social media and satellite-derived high-quality PM2.5 concentrations were collected to perform highly spatiotemporal exposure assessments for thirteen cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China. The city-scale exposure levels and the corresponding health outcomes were first estimated. Then the uncertainties in exposure risk assessments were quantified based on in-situ PM2.5 observations and static population data. The results showed that approximately half of the population living in the BTH region were exposed to monthly mean PM2.5 concentration greater than 80\u202f\u03bcg\/m3 in 2015, and the highest risk was observed in December. In terms of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease, the premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 were estimated to be 138,150, 80,945, and 18,752, respectively. A comparative analysis between five different exposure models further illustrated that the dynamic population distribution and accurate PM2.5 estimations showed great influence on environmental exposure and health assessments and need be carefully considered.

Basic prediction, divorced from causal inference, is much easier with big data. Emergency care may benefit from this simpler application of big data. Historically, predictive analytics have played an important role in emergency care as simple heuristics for risk stratification. These tools generally follow a standard approach: parsimonious criteria, easy computability, and independent validation with distinct populations. Simplicity in a prediction tool is valuable, but technological advances make it no longer a necessity. Emergency care could benefit from clinical predictions built using data science tools with abundant potential input variables available in electronic medical records. Patients\u2019 risks could be stratified more precisely with large pools of data and lower resource requirements for comparing each clinical encounter to those that came before it, benefiting clinical decisionmaking and health systems operations. The largest value of predictive analytics comes early in the clinical encounter, in which diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty are high and resource-committing decisions need to be made. We propose an agenda for widening the application of predictive analytics in emergency care. Throughout, we express cautious optimism because there are myriad challenges related to database infrastructure, practitioner uptake, and patient acceptance. The quality of routinely compiled clinical data will remain an important limitation.

From this corpus, we extracted data quality concepts, their definitions, applicable measures, their computability and identified conceptual relationships. We used these relationships to design and develop a data quality meta-model and implemented it in a quality knowledge repository.\nResults\nWe identified three primitives for programmatically performing data quality assessments: data quality concept, its definition, its measure or rule for data quality assessment, and their associations. We modeled a computable data quality meta-data repository and extended this framework to adapt, store, retrieve and automate assessment of other existing data quality assessment models.\nConclusion\nWe identified research gaps in data quality literature towards automating data quality assessments methods.

The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking\/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.","Dirk U.

The workflow is implemented with distributed Apache Spark programming primitives and tested on a cluster environment. We perform experiments to assess the performance of each module, separately and in a combined manner, considering the predictive modeling of one-day-ahead energy production, for multiple renewable energy sites. Accuracy results show that the proposed framework allows reducing the error up to 13.56%. Moreover, scalability results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of speedup, scaleup and execution time under a stress test.","Roberto Corizzo and Michelangelo Ceci and Nathalie Japkowicz","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bdr.2019.04.001","2019","Anomaly Detection and Repair for Accurate Predictions in Geo-distributed Big Data"],["This chapter considers the specific issues that Big Data presents for law enforcement agencies (LEAs).

A healthcare system is required to analyze a large amount of patient data, which helps to derive insights and predictions of disease. This system should be intelligent and able to predict the patient's health condition by analyzing the patient's lifestyle, physical health records, and social activities. The health recommendation system (HRS) is becoming an important platform for healthcare services. In this context, health intelligent systems have become indispensable tools in decision-making processes in the healthcare sector. The main objective is to ensure the availability of valuable information at the right time by ensuring information quality, trustworthiness, authentication, and privacy. As people use social networks to learn about their health condition, so the HRS is very important to derive outcomes such as recommending diagnosis, health insurance, clinical pathway-based treatment methods, and alternative medicines based on the patient's health profile. In this chapter, we discuss recent research that targeted utilization of large volumes of medical data while combining multimodal data from disparate sources, which reduces the workload and cost in healthcare. In the healthcare sector, big data analytics using a recommendation system has an important role in terms of decision-making processes regarding the patient's health. This chapter presents a proposed intelligent HRS that provides an insight into how to use big data analytics for implementing an effective health recommendation engine and shows how to transform the healthcare industry from the traditional scenario to more personalized paradigm in a tele-health environment. Our proposed intelligent HRS resulted in lower MAE value when compared to existing approaches.","Abhaya Kumar Sahoo and Sitikantha Mallik and Chittaranjan Pradhan and Bhabani Shankar Prasad Mishra and Rabindra Kumar Barik and Himansu Das","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/B978-0-12-818146-1.00009-X","2019","Chapter 9 - Intelligence-Based Health Recommendation System Using Big Data Analytics"],["Patients face difficulties identifying appropriate doctors owing to the sizeable quantity and uneven quality of information in online healthcare communities. In studying physician searches, researchers often focus on expertise similarity matches and sentiment analyses of reviews. However, the quality is often ignored. To address patients' information needs holistically, we propose a four-dimensional IT framework based on signaling theory. The model takes expertise knowledge, online reviews, profile descriptions (e.g., hospital reputation, number of patients, city) and service quality (e.g., response speed, interaction frequency, cost) as signals that distinguish high-quality physicians. It uses machine learning approaches to derive similarity matches and sentiment analysis. It also measures the relative importance of the signals by multi-criterion analysis and derives the physician rankings through the aggregated scores. Our study revealed that the proposed approach performs better compared with the other two recommend techniques. This research expands the boundary of signaling theory to healthcare management and enriches the literature on IT use and inter-organizational systems.

So far, most of the approaches for assuring data quality are typically data-centric, i.e., mainly focus on fixing data issues for specific values. However, organizations can also benefit from improving their capabilities of their DQM processes by developing organizational best DQM practices. In this regard, our investigation addresses how well organizations perform their DQM processes in the IoT domain. The main contribution of this study is to establish a framework for IoT DQM maturity. This framework is compliant with ISO 8000-61 (DQM: process reference model) and ISO 8000-62 (DQM: organizational process maturity assessment) and can be used to assess and improve the capabilities of the DQM processes for IoT data. The framework is composed of two elements. First, a process reference model (PRM) for IoT DQM is proposed by extending the PRM for DQM defined in ISO 8000-61, tailoring some existing processes and adding new ones. Second, a maturity model suitable for IoT data is proposed based on the PRM for IoT DQM. The maturity model, named IoT DQM3, is proposed by extending the maturity model defined in ISO 8000-62. However, in order to increase the usability of IoT DQM3, we consider adequate the proposition of a simplification of the IoT DQM3, by introducing a lightweight version to reduce assessment indicators and facilitate its industrial adoption. A simplified method to measure the capability of a process is also suggested considering the relationship of process attributes with the measurement stack defined in ISO 8000-63. The empirical validation of the maturity model is twofold. First, the appropriateness of the two models is surveyed with data quality experts who are currently working in various organizations around the world. Second, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, the light-weight version is applied to a manufacturing company as a case study.","Sunho Kim and Ricardo P\u00e9rez-Castillo and Ismael Caballero and Downgwoo Lee","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jii.2021.100256","2022","Organizational process maturity model for IoT data quality management"],["The entity reconciliation (ER) problem aroused much interest as a research topic in today's Big Data era, full of big and open heterogeneous data sources.

ER is an operational intelligence process, whereby organizations can unify different and heterogeneous data sources in order to relate possible matches of non-obvious entities. Besides, the complexity that the heterogeneity of data sources involves, the large number of records and differences among languages, for instance, must be added.

Traditionally, these cooperation behavior are analyzed in a holistic and non-quantitative way, where the complicated relationships among various enterprises cannot be well represented. In this work, we propose to understand the low-carbon entrepreneurs\u2019 cooperation by leveraging a massive-scale dense subgraph mining technique, based on which an evolutionary graphical model is built to dynamically represent such complex relationships. More specifically, given million-scale low-carbon enterprises, we first extract multiple biologically-aware features (e.g., production value and carbon emission) to represent each of them. Based on this, a massive-scale affinity network is constructed to characterize the relationships among these enterprises. Based on this, an efficient subgraph mining algorithm (called graph shift) is deployed to discover the neighbors for each enterprise. Finally, based on the discovered neighbors of each enterprise, we can build a graphical model to represent the relationships among explicitly\/implicitly-connected enterprises. The flows of multiple attributes (benefit exchange and resources swap) can be modeled effectively. To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we manually label the attributes of 20,000 enterprises, based on which a classification model is trained by encoding the neighboring attributes of each enterprise. Comparative results have clearly demonstrated the competitiveness of our method.

Firstly, a multimodal data fusion approach is proposed to build a QoE mapping between the uncontrollable user data with the controllable network-related system data. Secondly, an automatic QoE optimization model is built taking fused results, which is different from the traditional way. QoEDF is able to adjust network-related system data automatically so as to achieve optimized user satisfaction. Simulation results show that QoEDF will lead to significant improvements in QoE level as well as be adaptable to dynamic network changes.","Xiaohong Huang and Kun Xie and Supeng Leng and Tingting Yuan and Maode Ma","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2018.02.046","2018","Improving Quality of Experience in multimedia Internet of Things leveraging machine learning on big data"],[null,"Suzanne McDermott and Margaret A.

We designed a multi-version data strategy and propose a data-pricing bi-level programming model based on the data quality to maximize the profit by the owner of the data platform and the utility to consumers. A genetic algorithm was used to solve the model. The numerical solutions for the data-pricing model indicate that the multi-version strategy achieves a better market segmentation and is more profitable and feasible when the multiple dimensions of data quality are considered.

To keep pace, companies need to establish extensive knowledge about their business and its surroundings based on insights generated through the analysis of data. The digital shadow is a novel information system concept that integrates data of heterogeneous sources to provide product-related information to stakeholders across the company. The concept aims at improving the results of decision making, enabling advanced data analyses, and increasing information handling efficiency. As insufficient information quality has immediate effects on the utility of the information and induces significant costs, managing the quality of the digital shadow data basis is crucial. However, there are currently no comprehensive methodologies for the assessment and improvement of the data quality of digital shadows. Therefore, this paper introduces a methodology that supports the derivation of data quality projects aimed at optimizing the digital shadow data basis. The proposed methodology comprises four steps: First, digital shadow use cases along the product lifecycle are described. Next, the use cases are prioritized with regard to the expected benefits of applying the digital shadow. Third, quality deficiencies in the digital shadow data basis are assessed with respect to use case specific requirements. Finally, the prioritized use cases in relation with the identified quality deficits allow deriving needs for action, which are addressed by data quality projects. Together, the data quality projects constitute a data quality program.

With biomedical imaging research increasingly using large datasets, it becomes critical to find operator-free methods to quality control the data collected and the associated analysis. Attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform automated quality control (QC) for both single-site and multi-site datasets have been explored in some neuroimaging techniques (e.g. EEG or MRI), although these methods struggle to find replication in other domains. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of an automated QC pipeline for brain [18F]-FDOPA PET imaging as a biomarker for the dopamine system. Methods. Two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used and combined to assess spatial misalignment to a standard template and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to 200 static [18F]-FDOPA PET images that had been manually quality controlled from three different PET\/CT scanners. The scans were combined with an additional 400 scans, in which misalignment (200 scans) and low SNR (200 scans) were simulated. A cross-validation was performed, where 80% of the data were used for training and 20% for validation. Two additional datasets of [18F]-FDOPA PET images (50 and 100 scans respectively with at least 80% of good quality images) were used for out-of-sample validation. Results. The CNN performance was excellent in the training dataset (accuracy for motion: 0.86 \u00b1 0.01, accuracy for SNR: 0.69 \u00b1 0.01), leading to 100% accurate QC classification when applied to the two out-of-sample datasets. Data dimensionality reduction affected the generalizability of the CNNs, especially when the classifiers were applied to the out-of-sample data from 3D to 1D datasets. Conclusions. This feasibility study shows that it is possible to perform automatic QC of [18F]-FDOPA PET imaging with CNNs. The approach has the potential to be extended to other PET tracers in both brain and non-brain applications, but it is dependent on the availability of large datasets necessary for the algorithm training.","Antonella D.

Most of these alternatives sit on the cloud and benefit from cloud computing, which is nowadays a reality that helps us to save money by eliminating the hardware as well as software fixed costs and just pay per use. On top of this, specific querying frameworks to exploit the brute force in the cloud (e.g., MapReduce) have also been devised. The question arising next tries to clear out if this (rather naive) exploitation of the cloud is an alternative to tuning DBMSs or it still makes sense to consider other options when retrieving data from these settings.

This paper describes the DQ program currently in place at AP-HP and the lessons learned from two DQ campaigns initiated in 2017.\nMaterials and Methods\nAs part of the AP-HP DQ program, two domains - patient identification (PI) and healthcare services (HS) - were selected for conducting DQ campaigns consisting of 5 phases: defining the scope, measuring, analyzing, improving and controlling DQ. Semi-automated DQ profiling was conducted in two data sets \u2013 the PI data set containing 8.8\u202fM patients and the HS data set containing 13,099 consultation agendas and 2122 care units. Seventeen DQ measures were defined and DQ issues were classified using a unified DQ reporting framework. For each domain, actions plans were defined for improving and monitoring prioritized DQ issues.\nResults\nEleven identified DQ issues (8 for the PI data set and 3 for the HS data set) were categorized into completeness (n\u202f=\u202f6), conformance (n\u202f=\u202f3) and plausibility (n\u202f=\u202f2) DQ issues. DQ issues were caused by errors from data originators, ETL issues or limitations of the EHR data entry tool. The action plans included sixteen actions (9 for the PI domain and 7 for the HS domain). Though only partial implementation, the DQ campaigns already resulted in significant improvement of DQ measures.\nConclusion\nDQ assessments of hospital information systems are largely unpublished. The preliminary results of two DQ campaigns conducted at AP-HP illustrate the benefit of the engagement into a DQ program. The adoption of a unified DQ reporting framework enables the communication of DQ findings in a well-defined manner with a shared vocabulary. Dedicated tooling is needed to automate and extend the scope of the generic DQ program. Specific DQ checks will be additionally defined on a per-study basis to evaluate whether EHR data fits for specific uses.","Christel Daniel and Patricia Serre and Nina Orlova and St\u00e9phane Br\u00e9ant and Nicolas Paris and Nicolas Griffon","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cmpb.2018.10.016","2019","Initializing a hospital-wide data quality program.

The ambition of TAQIH is to support non-technical users on 1) the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process of tabular health data, and 2) the assessment and improvement of its quality.\nMethods\nA web-based tool has been implemented with a simple yet powerful visual interface. First, it provides interfaces to understand the dataset, to gain the understanding of the content, structure and distribution. Then, it provides data visualization and improvement utilities for the data quality dimensions of completeness, accuracy, redundancy and readability.\nResults\nIt has been applied in two different scenarios. (1) The Northern Ireland General Practitioners (GPs) Prescription Data, an open data set containing drug prescriptions. (2) A glucose monitoring tele health system dataset. Findings on (1) include: Features that had significant amount of missing values (e.g. AMP_NM variable 53.39%); instances that have high percentage of variable values missing (e.g. 0.21% of the instances with\u202f>\u202f75% of missing values); highly correlated variables (e.g. Gross and Actual cost almost completely correlated (\u223c\u202f+\u202f1.0)). Findings on (2) include: Features that had significant amount of missing values (e.g. patient height, weight and body mass index (BMI) (>\u202f70%), date of diagnosis 13%)); highly correlated variables (e.g. height, weight and BMI). Full detail of the testing and insights related to findings are reported.\nConclusions\nTAQIH enables and supports users to carry out EDA on tabular health data and to assess and improve its quality. Having the layout of the application menu arranged sequentially as the conventional EDA pipeline helps following a consistent analysis process. The general description of the dataset and features section is very useful for the first overview of the dataset. The missing value heatmap is also very helpful in visually identifying correlations among missing values. The correlations section has proved to be supportive as a preliminary step before further data analysis pipelines, as well as the outliers section. Finally, the data quality section provides a quantitative value to the dataset improvements.","Roberto {\u00c1lvarez S\u00e1nchez} and Andoni {Beristain Iraola} and Gorka {Epelde Unanue} and Paul Carlin","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cmpb.2018.12.029","2019","TAQIH, a tool for tabular data quality assessment and improvement in the context of health data"],["Improving the operational energy efficiency of existing ships is attracting considerable interests to reduce the environmental footprint due to air emissions.

We contrasted the manipulation of data quantity (sampling error, by varying the number of subjects) against the manipulation of data quality (measurement error, by varying the number of data per subject) in a simulated Bayesian model identifiability study. The results were clear-cut in showing that - across all levels of signal-to-noise ratios - varying the number of subjects was completely inconsequential, whereas the number of data per subject exerted massive effects on model identifiability. These results emphasize data quality over data quantity, and they call for the integration of statistics and measurement theory.","Antonio Kolossa and Bruno Kopp","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2018.01.005","2018","Data quality over data quantity in computational cognitive neuroscience"],["We use a new property-level data set and an innovative methodology to estimate the price of land from 2000 to 2013 for nearly the universe of detached single-family homes in the Washington, DC metro area and to characterize the boom-bust cycle in land and house prices at a fine geography.

The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is a common AC system for residential buildings in China. In most previous studies on VRF systems, onsite measurements or surveys were conducted to collect operational data. These traditional methods may face various data issues, such as limited sample sizes and invalid data, making them unable to capture the spatial and temporal performance features of VRF systems in residential buildings on a large scale. To fill this gap, with advances in data storage and transmission technology, Big Data methods have been widely used for data collection. In the present study, researchers adopted 16,985 sets of VRF system operation data from China as the database and conducted data analysis for both the spatial and temporal dimensions.

In the past, traffic data were usually acquired and disseminated by government agencies through fixed-location sensors. High costs, infrastructure demands, and low coverage levels of these sensor devices require agencies and researchers to look beyond the traditional approaches. With the emergence of smartphones and navigation apps, location-based and crowdsourced Big Data are receiving increased attention. In this regard, location-based big data (LocBigData) collected from probe vehicles and road users can be used to provide speed and travel time information in different locations. Examining the quality of crowdsourced data is essential for researchers and agencies before using them. This study assessed the quality of Waze speed data from surface streets and conducted a case study in Sevierville, Tennessee. Typically, examining the quality of these data in surface streets and arterials is more challenging than freeways data. This research used Bluetooth speed data as the ground truth, which is independent of Waze data. In this study, three steps of methodology were used. In the first step, Waze speed data was compared to Bluetooth data in terms of accuracy, mean difference, and distribution similarity. In the second step, a k-means algorithm was used to categorize Waze data quality, and a multinomial logistics regression model was performed to explore the significant factors that impact data quality. Finally, in the third step, machine learning techniques were conducted to predict the data quality in different conditions. The result of the comparison showed a similar pattern and a slight difference between datasets, which verified the quality of Waze speed data. The statistical model indicates that that Waze speed data are more accurate in peak hours than in night hours. Also, the traffic speed, traffic volume, and segment length have a significant association on the accuracy of Waze data on surface streets. Finally, the result of machine learning prediction showed that a KNN method performed the highest prediction accuracy of 84.5% and 82.9% of the time for training and test datasets, respectively. Overall, the study results suggest that Waze speed data is a promising data source for surface streets.","Nima Hoseinzadeh and Yuandong Liu and Lee D.

Besides the pure ordinal information about the level of quality, numerical information is induced when considering uncertainty involved during measurement. In the case where uncertainty is modelled as probability, this numerical information is ratio-scaled. An essential property of the mentioned approach is that the application of a measure on a large collection of data can be represented efficiently in the sense that (i) the representation has a low storage complexity and (ii) it can be updated incrementally when new data are observed. However, this property only holds when the evaluation of predicates is clear and does not deal with uncertainty. For some dimensions of quality, this assumption is far too strong and uncertainty comes into play almost naturally. In this paper, we investigate how the presence of uncertainty influences the efficiency of a measurement procedure. Hereby, we focus specifically on the case where uncertainty is caused by insufficient information and is thus modelled by means of possibility theory. It is shown that the amount of data that reaches a certain level of quality, can be summarized as a possibility distribution over the set of natural numbers.

Results show that the four accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the nearest service (minimum time) alone fails to reflect the multidimensional nature of healthy food accessibility. The communities within Shenzhen present quite different typology with respect to healthy food accessibility under different transport modes. Multilevel additive regression is further applied to examine the associations between healthy food accessibility and nested socioeconomic characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). We discover that the associations are divergent with transport modes and with geographic levels. More specifically, significant social equalities in healthy food accessibility are identified via walking, public transit, and bicycle in Shenzhen.

Historic data is increasingly being replaced by modernized data, such as big data, which is regarded as data that exhibits the 5Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value. The capacity to optimally use and comprehend value from big data has become an indispensable aptitude for modern companies. In contrast to commercial and technology firms, usage, management and governance of data, including big data is a novel and evolving trend for mining and mineral industries. Although the mining industry can be unenthusiastic to change, embracing modernized data and big data is evolutionarily unavoidable, given many industry-wide challenges (i.e., fluctuation in commodity prices, geotechnical and harsh ground conditions, and ore grade), which corrode revenues and increase business risks, including the possibility of regulatory non-compliance. The minerals industry holds a genuine gold mine of data that were collected for scientific, engineering, operational and other purposes. Data and data-centric workspaces that are targeted towards innovation and experimentation, which if combined with in-discipline expertise are two harmonious ingredients that can provide many practical solutions for the mining and mineral industries.

Although there were no significant differences between the automatic method and the manual method, we detected differences in values for five variables, including one plausibility error and two conformance and completeness errors. Plausibility: 1) Sex, ICU-DaMa incorrectly classified one male patient as female (error generated by the Hospital\u2019s Admissions Department). Conformance: 2) Reason for isolation, ICU-DaMa failed to detect a human error in which a professional misclassified a patient\u2019s isolation. 3) Brain death, ICU-DaMa failed to detect another human error in which a professional likely entered two mutually exclusive values related to the death of the patient (brain death and controlled donation after circulatory death).

Although data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are limited, recent investigations, such as the African Surgical Outcomes Study, highlight that despite operating on low risk patients, there is increased postoperative mortality in LMICs versus higher-resource settings, a majority of which occur secondary to seemingly preventable complications like surgical site infections. We propose that implementing creative, low-cost surgical outcomes monitoring and select quality improvement systems proven effective in high-income countries, such as surgical infection prevention programs and safety checklists, can enhance the delivery of safe surgical care in existing LMIC surgical systems. While efforts to initiate and expand surgical access and capacity continues to deserve attention in the global health community, here we advocate for creative modifications to current service structures, such as promoting a culture of safety, employing technology and mobile health (mHealth) for patient data collection and follow-up, and harnessing partnerships for information sharing, to create a framework for improving morbidity and mortality in responsible, scalable, and sustainable ways.","Belain Eyob and Marissa A.

Prior to the experiments, network latency, file size and job failures were identified as factors which degrade performance and experiments were conducted to understand their impacts. Organizational Sustainability Modeling (OSM) is used before, during and after the experiments to ensure fair comparisons are achieved. OSM defines the actual and expected execution time, risk control rates and is used to understand key outputs related to both Cloud and non-Cloud experiments. Forty experiments on both Cloud and non-Cloud systems were undertaken with two case studies. The first case study was focused on transferring and backing up 10,000 files of 1 GB each and the second case study was focused on transferring and backing up 1000 files 10 GB each. Results showed that first, the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud was lower than on the non-Cloud system. Second, there was more than 99% consistency between the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud while no comparable consistency was found on the non-Cloud system.

At the same time, the integration of various research angles and data types is crucial for modelling the complexity of organisms and biological processes in a holistic manner. This is especially valid in the context of drug development and chemical safety assessment where computational methods can provide solutions for the urgent need of fast, effective, and sustainable approaches.

Therefore, KGs have immense potential to advance the data centred approach, the re-usability, and informativity of data.

Nowadays, it becomes more and more common that data of different quality, originating from different data sets and different data providers have to be integrated and processed in order to compute the suitability degrees. Also, data sets can be very large such that their data become commonly prone to incompleteness, imprecision and uncertainty. Hence, not all data used for decision making can be trusted to the same extent and consequently, neither the results of computations with such data can be trusted to the same extent. For this reason, data quality assessment becomes an important aspect of a decision making process. To correctly inform the users, it is essential to communicate not only the computed suitability degrees of the available options, but also the confidence about these suitability degrees as can be derived from data quality assessment. In this paper a novel multi-dimensional approach for data quality assessment in multi-criteria decision making, supporting the computation of associated confidence degrees, is presented.

The capacity and MVF are uploaded to the cloud big data platform, and then the mean and variance of the MVF is predicted based on the relevance vector machine, thereby realizing the 2\u03c3 range prediction of the lithium battery's state of health and the probability density function prediction of the remaining useful life.

These data are collected in different forms and formats. The inconsistent data could be handled using various techniques of big data. The information obtained from big data analytics can be used for the prediction of diseases or conditions using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. 5G plays an important role in healthcare informatics by enabling real-time remote monitoring and improving augmented reality, virtual reality, and spatial computing. With 5G technologies, a large number of devices can be connected using high-performance computing over large distances to provide healthcare services. Blockchain is applied in healthcare for health record management, insurance claims, drug tracking, authentication, and ensuring the integrity of medical data. Deep learning techniques can be applied to ever-changing data for the detection and prevention of disease. For the classification challenge, deep convolutional neural networks using pictures of diseased regions are often utilized.

To explore this issue, this paper adopts the sentiment analysis method to construct a real-time daily subjective well-being metric at the city level based on the big data of online search traces. Using daily data from 13 Chinese cities centred on Beijing between August 2014 and December 2019, we look at the corelation between subjective well-being and air pollution and the heterogeneity in this relationship based on two separate identification strategies. We find that air pollutants are negatively correlated with subjective well-being, and well-being tends to decline more from pollution during hot seasons. In addition, residents in wealthier regions tend to be more sensitive to air pollution. This result may be explained by the differences in the subjective perception of air pollution and personal preferences at different levels of income. These findings provide information about the concerns of the public to the central government, thereby helping it take appropriate actions to respond to the dynamics of subjective well-being.","Lu Cheng and Zhifu Mi and Yi-Ming Wei and Shidong Wang and Klaus Hubacek","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jclepro.2022.134380","2022","Dirty skies lower subjective well-being"],["Because of big data on energy consumption, there is a lack of research on the discrete manufacturing system.

The paper derives human reliability data for two driving tasks, stopping at red signals and controlling speed on approach to buffer stops. In the first of these cases, a tool has been developed that can estimate the number of times a signal is approached at red by trains on the Great Britain (GB) rail network. The tool has been developed using big data techniques and ideas, recording and analysing millions of pieces of data from live operational feeds to update and summarise statistics from thousands of signal locations in GB on a daily basis. The resulting driver reliability data are compared to similar analyses of other train driving tasks. This shows human reliability approaching the currently accepted limits of human performance. It also shows higher error rates amongst freight train drivers than passenger train drivers for these tasks. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the task specific performance limits if further improvements in human reliability are sought. It also provides a practical example of how big data could play an increasingly important role in system error management, whether from the perspective of understanding normal performance and the limits of performance for specific tasks or as the basis for dynamic safety indicators which, if not leading, could at least become closer to real time.","Chris Harrison and Julian Stow and Xiaocheng Ge and Jonathan Gregory and Huw Gibson and Alice Monk","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.apergo.2022.103795","2022","At the limit?

However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions, and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice of DT and its allied technologies.","Angira Sharma and Edward Kosasih and Jie Zhang and Alexandra Brintrup and Anisoara Calinescu","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jii.2022.100383","2022","Digital Twins: State of the art theory and practice, challenges, and open research questions"],["While the use of big data tends to add value for business throughout the entire value chain, the integration of big data analytics (BDA) to the decision-making process remains a challenge.

In the era of Big Data, this task has gained notorious attention due to the intrinsic quadratic complexity of the problem in relation to the size of the dataset. In practice, this task can be outsourced to a cloud service, and thus, a service customer may be interested in estimating the costs of a record linkage solution before executing it. Since the execution time of a record linkage solution depends on a combination of various algorithms, their respective parameter values and the employed cloud infrastructure, in practice it is hard to perform an a priori estimation of infrastructure costs for executing a record linkage task. Besides estimating customer costs, the estimation of record linkage costs is also important to evaluate whether (or not) the application of a set of RL parameter values will satisfy predefined time and budget restrictions. Aiming to tackle these challenges, we propose a theoretical model for estimating RL costs taking into account the main steps that may influence the execution time of the RL task. We also propose an algorithm, denoted as TBF, for evaluating the feasibility of RL parameter values, given a set of predefined customer restrictions. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model combined with regression techniques using record linkage results processed in real distributed environments.

To further study the role of the Internet service platform, this paper considers a CLSC composed of a manufacturer, a retailer and an Internet service platform who invests in research and development (R&D), advertising and Big Data marketing, and develops the goodwill dynamic model based on the differential game theory. The construction of a goodwill dynamic model has two purposes, namely, to increase sales and the return rate. The optimal decisions for 3 players under two different cooperative scenarios are obtained, namely, the retailer payment scenario (scenario D) and the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario (scenario S). The supply chain members gain more profit or achieve a higher level of goodwill for products under certain conditions, i.e., a high residual value from remanufacturing, a high sharing rate of residual value from the retailer's recycled products, and a low recycling cost. Interestingly, the wholesale price increases with the residual value of recycled products when goodwill effectiveness is low, while the price declines when goodwill effectiveness is high. After comparing two cooperative scenarios, the result shows that an Internet service platform will invest more in Big Data marketing under the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario, and cooperation between the manufacturer and the Internet service platform can help improve the goodwill of enterprises or products. Moreover, the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario is payoff-Pareto-improving in most cases through the coordination of a cost-sharing rate, and the effectiveness of Big Data marketing exerts a positive effect on goodwill and the development of the industry. In addition, the retailer has \u201cfree rider\u201d tendencies in the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario.

In addition, fewer methodologies offer a complete guideline across team, project and data & information management. In this article we would like to explore the necessity of developing a more holistic approach for carrying out data science projects. We first review methodologies that have been presented on the literature to work on data science projects and classify them according to the their focus: project, team, data and information management. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework containing general characteristics that a methodology for managing data science projects with a holistic point of view should have. This framework can be used by other researchers as a roadmap for the design of new data science methodologies or the updating of existing ones.","I\u00f1igo Martinez and Elisabeth Viles and Igor {G.

Millions of people are interested in sharing their views through tweets. Healthcare predictions are one of the attractive researches in big data social mining. Healthcare predictions are derived by implementing topic models by the ailments data. An ailment refers to either illness or sign of a particular health problem. Millions of tweets are collected based on conditions and assessed with ailment topic aspect models. The existing topic model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Indexing, Probabilistic LSI (PLSI), limits the healthcare results assessment concerning any one of the ailments aspects. Recent ailments topic aspect model (ATAM) overcome the problems of these topic models and delivers the healthcare assessment results concerning the fundamental aspects of ailments data except side-effects analysis of treatments. The scalability performance of ATAM is degraded in showing healthcare results over the massive amounts of health data. A high-performance computing model of ATAM has been developed in the distributed environment to address scalability. Its intelligent model is designed in the cloud and multi-node Hadoop environment to deliver high-performance social computing results for healthcare.

Specifically, data governance was first quantified with ten detailed indicators, which were then selected for explaining urban fire risk through correlation analysis. Next, the sample cities were clustered in terms of major socio-economic characteristics, and then the effects of data governance were examined by constructing multivariate regression models for each city cluster with ordinary least squares (OLS). The results showed that the constructed regression models produced good interpretation of fire risk in different types of cities, with coefficient of determination (R2) in each model exceeding 0.65. Among the indicators, the development of infrastructures (e.g. data collection devices and data analysis platforms), the level of data use, and the updating of fire risk related data were proved to produce significant effects on the reduction of fire frequency and fire consequence. Moreover, the organizational maturity of data governance was proved to be helpful in reducing fire frequency. For the cities with large population, the cross-department sharing of high-value data was found to be another important determinant of urban fire frequency. In comparison with existing statistical models which interpreted fire risk with general social factors (with the highest R2\u00a0=\u00a00.60), these new regression models presented a better statistical performance (with the average R2\u00a0=\u00a00.72).

The insight of this paper is that lossy compression can unleash the power of compression to IoT because, as compared with its counterpart (a lossless one), it can significantly reduce the data volume when the spatiotemporal characteristics of IoT sensor data are properly exploited. However, lossy compression faces the challenge of compressing too much data thus losing data fidelity, which might affect the quality of the data and potential analytics outcomes. To understand the impact of lossy compression on IoT data management and analytics, we evaluated four classification algorithms with reconstructed agricultural sensor data based on various energy concentration. Specifically, we applied three transformation-based lossy compression mechanisms to five real-world weather datasets collected at different sampling granularities from IoT weather stations. Our experimental results indicate that there is a strong positive correlation between the concentrated energy of the transformed coefficients and the compression ratio as well as the data quality. While we observed a general trend where much higher compression ratios can be achieved at the cost of a decrease in quality, we also observed that the impact on the classification accuracy varies among the data sets and algorithms we evaluated.

This study aims to explore the data management challenges encountered by practitioners developing systems with DL components, identify the potential solutions from the literature and validate the solutions through a multiple case study. We identified 20 data management challenges experienced by DL practitioners through a multiple interpretive case study. Further, we identified 48 articles through a systematic literature review that discuss the solutions for the data management challenges. With the second round of multiple case study, we show that many of these solutions have limitations and are not used in practice due to a combination of four factors: high cost, lack of skill-set and infrastructure, inability to solve the problem completely, and incompatibility with certain DL use cases. Thus, data management for data-intensive DL models in production is complicated.

Mass spectral analysis derived from matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time of flight (ToF) data has been proven to be a cost effective method for clinical diagnostics. However, urine mass spectra are complex and require data modelling frameworks. Therefore, computational approaches that systematically analyse big data generated from MALDI-ToF mass spectra are essential. To address this issue, we developed an automated workflow that successfully processed large data sets from MALDI-ToF which is 100-fold faster than using a common software tool. Our method performs accurate data quality control decisions, and generates a comparative analysis to extract peak intensity patterns from a data set. We successfully applied our framework to the identification of peak intensity patterns for Trisomy 21 and Trisomy 18 gestations on data sets from maternal pregnancy urines obtained in the UK and China. The results from our automated comparative analysis have shown characteristic patterns associated with aneuploidies in the first trimester pregnancy.

The individual biospecimens will be analyzed for 19 substances. The long-term-storage biological samples will be used for the further substance analysis. The Ko-CHENS will investigate whether the environmental variables including the perinatal outdoor and indoor factors and the greenness contribute causally to the health outcomes in the children and adolescents. In addition to the individual surveys, the assessments of the outdoor exposures and health outcomes will use the national air-quality monitoring data and claim data of the NHIS, respectively.

We employ PRISMA to identify 32 key papers relevant to this topic. Our analysis shows an increasing use of data mining and machine learning tasks and techniques, including prediction, classification, clustering, association rules mining, and deep learning, over the last decade. However, it also reveals a number of critical challenges in applying these to the study of vector-host-pathogen interactions at various systems biology levels. Here, relevant studies, current limitations and future directions are discussed. Furthermore, the quality of data in relevant papers was assessed using the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) compliance criteria to evaluate and encourage reproducibility and shareability of research outcomes. Although shortcomings in their application remain, data mining and machine learning have significant potential to break new ground in understanding fundamental aspects of vector-host-pathogen relationships and their application in this field should be encouraged.

To assess whether these goals are achieved, it is necessary to implement a performance management system (PMS). However, a PMS must take into account the various challenges associated with Industry 4.0, including the availability of large amounts of data. While it represents an opportunity for companies to improve performance, big data does not necessarily mean good data. It can be uncertain, imprecise, ambiguous, etc. Uncertainty is one of the major challenges and it is essential to take it into account when computing performance indicators to increase confidence in decision making. To address this issue, we propose a method to model uncertainty in key performance indicators (KPIs). Our work allows associating with each indicator an uncertainty noted m, computed on the basis of the theory of belief functions. The KPI and its associated uncertainty form a pair (KP I, m). The method developed allows calculating this uncertainty m for the input data of the performance management system. We show how these modeled uncertainties should be propagated to the KPIs. For these KPI uncertainties, we have defined rules to support decision-making. The method developed, based on the theory of belief functions, is part of a methodology we propose to define and extract smart data from massive data. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use this theory to model uncertain performance indicators. Our work has shown its effectiveness and its applicability to a case of bottle filling line simulation.

However, while the effect of height on pollen concentration was clear, it was also limited (average ratio 1.3, range 0.7\u20132.2). The standard deviation of the pollen ratio was highly variable when the lower station was located close to the ground level (below 10\u202fm AGL).

Empirical research comprised a mixed methods approach using (1) a Delphi study with practitioners through various forums and (2) interviews with business analytics managers in three case organizations. The case studies reinforced the Delphi findings and highlighted several challenge focal areas: organizations need a clear data and analytics strategy, the right people to effect a data-driven cultural change, and to consider data and information ethics when using data for competitive advantage. Further, becoming data-driven is not merely a technical issue and demands that organizations firstly organize their business analytics departments to comprise business analysts, data scientists, and IT personnel, and secondly align that business analytics capability with their business strategy in order to tackle the analytics challenge in a systemic and joined-up way.

To initiate a discussion of how to evaluate and report on the quality of digital trace data in IS research, we couch our arguments within the broader tradition of research on data quality. We explain how the uncontrolled nature of digital trace data creates unique challenges for IS researchers, who need to collect, store, retrieve, and transform those data for the purpose of numerical analysis. We then draw parallels with concepts and patterns commonly used in data analysis projects and argue that, although IS researchers probably apply such concepts and patterns, this is not reported in publications, undermining the reader's ability to assess the reliability, statistical power and replicability of the findings. Using the case of GitHub to illustrate such challenges, we develop a preliminary set of guidelines to help researchers consider and report on the quality of the digital trace data they use in their research.

Although these technologies have the potential to advance quality standards, it is not a trivial task. A significant portion of quality leaders do not yet have a clear deployment strategy and universally cite difficulty in harnessing such technologies. The lack of people power is one of the biggest challenges. From a career development standpoint, the higher-educated employees (such as engineers) are the most exposed to, and thus affected by, these new technologies. 79% of young professionals have reported receiving training outside of formal schooling to acquire the necessary skills for Industry 4.0.

Effective insurance can serve as both a measure to distribute, and a method to communicate risk. In order for insurance to fulfil these roles successfully, policy pricing and cover choices must be risk-based and founded on accurate information. This is reliant on a robust evidence base forming the foundation of policy choices. This paper focuses on the evidence available to insurers and emergent innovation in the use of data. The main risk considered is coastal flooding, for which the insurance sector offers an option for potential adaptation, capable of increasing resilience. However, inadequate supply and analysis of data have been highlighted as factors preventing insurance from fulfilling this role. Research was undertaken to evaluate how data are currently, and could potentially, be used within risk evaluations for the insurance industry. This comprised of 50 interviews with those working and associated with the London insurance market. The research reveals new opportunities, which could facilitate improvements in risk-reflective pricing of policies. These relate to a new generation of data collection techniques and analytics, such as those associated with satellite-derived data, IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, cloud computing, and Big Data solutions. Such technologies present opportunities to reduce moral hazard through basing predictions and pricing of risk on large empirical datasets. The value of insurers' claims data is also revealed, and is shown to have the potential to refine, calibrate, and validate models and methods. The adoption of such data-driven techniques could enable insurers to re-evaluate risk ratings, and in some instances, extend coverage to locations and developments, previously rated as too high a risk to insure. Conversely, other areas may be revealed more vulnerable, which could generate negative impacts for residents in these regions, such as increased premiums.

We present a mobile crowdsensing system to achieve the fine-grained quality control, and formulate the problem of maximizing the social cost such that the fine-grained ability requirement of all sensing tasks can be satisfied. To stimulate the workers with long-term high quality, we design two ability reputation systems to assess workers\u2019 fine-grained abilities online. The incentive mechanism based on the reverse auction and fine-grained ability reputation system is proposed. We design a greedy algorithm to select the winners and determine the payment based on the bids and fine-grained ability reputation of workers. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, whitewashing proof, and guaranteed approximation.

For injection wells, shut-in data can be collected and analyzed after each injection cycle to evaluate the well injectivity and predict the well longevity. However, any interactive analysis of the pressure data could be subjective and time-consuming. In this study a novel cloud-based approach to automatically analyzing pressure data is presented, which aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of pressure transient analysis. There are two fundamental requirements for automated pressure transient analysis: 1) Pressure data needs to be automatically retrieved from field sites and fed to the analyzer; 2) The engineer can automatically select instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP), identify flow regimes, and determine the fracture closure point if any. To meet these requirements as well as to take advantage of cloud storage and computing technologies, a web-based application has been developed to pull real time injection data from any field sites and push it to a cloud database. A built-in pressure transient workflow has been also proposed to detect any stored or real-time pressure data and perform pressure analysis automatically if the required data is available. The automated pressure transient analysis technology has been applied to multiple injection projects. In general, the analysis results including formation and fracture properties (i.e. permeability, fracture half length, skin factor, and fracture closure pressure) are comparable to results from interactive analysis. Any discrepancies are mainly caused by poor data quality. Issues such as inconsistent selections of ISIP and different slopes defined for pre and after closure analyses also contribute to the divergence. Overall, the automated pressure transient analysis provides consistent results as the exact same criteria are applied to the pressure data, and analysis results are independent of the analyzer's experience and knowledge. As data from oil\/gas industry increases exponentially over time, automated data transmission, storage, analysis and access are becoming necessary to maximize the value of the data and reduce operation cost. The automated pressure transient analysis presented here demonstrates that cloud storage and computing combined with automated analysis tools is a viable way to overcome big data challenges faced by oil\/gas industry professionals.","Yonggui Guo and Ibrahim Mohamed and Ali Zidane and Yashesh Panchal and Omar Abou-Sayed and Ahmed Abou-Sayed","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.petrol.2020.107627","2021","Automated pressure transient analysis: A cloud-based approach"],["Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer exciting new avenues for leadership research.

Machine learning is an optional assessment method because of its high objectivity and computational efficiency, but how to get enough and accurate information of historical flood locations to train the machine learning models has been a key problem. In recent years, news media data from both news websites and social media accounts has emerged as a promising source for natural science studies. However, the application of news media data in urban flood susceptibility assessment is still inadequate. This study proposed an approach to fill this gap. Firstly, flood locations were extracted from news media data based on a named entity recognition (NER) model. Then, a frequency or distance-based data quality control method was employed to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations. Finally, flood conditioning factors with information of historical flood locations were input into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for flood susceptibility assessment. We took the central city of Dalian, China as a case study. The T-test results show that there was no significant difference between the distributions of most flood conditioning factors at the flood locations from the news media data and the official planning report. In the obtained flood susceptibility map, the high flood susceptibility areas got a recall of 90% compared with the high flood hazard areas in the planning report. Performing data quality control in the frequency-based method can improve the precision of the flood susceptibility map by up to 5%, while the distance-based method is ineffective.

Yet managers lack clear insights on the way social media should be managed and current literature is dispersed across various research streams. In this article, the authors aim to develop a better understanding of how social media use should be leveraged for innovation. To achieve this objective, they build a systematic review of evidence from 177 scientific articles across four key management disciplines. They analyze research perspectives and conceptualizations of social media use for innovation and provide a framework of the drivers, contingencies and outcomes related to this topic. Next, they attempt to identify what is currently known about social media use for innovation. Last, they suggest critical areas for future inquiry on this important subject.","Marie-Isabelle Muninger and Dominik Mahr and Wafa Hammedi","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jbusres.2022.01.039","2022","Social media use: A review of innovation management practices"],["The data lake approach has emerged as a promising way to handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data. This big data technology enables enterprises to profoundly improve their Business Intelligence. However, there is a lack of empirical studies on the use of the data lake approach in enterprises. This paper provides the results of an exploratory study designed to improve the understanding of the use of the data lake approach in enterprises. I interviewed 12 experts who had implemented this approach in various enterprises and identified three important purposes of implementing data lakes: (1) as staging areas or sources for data warehouses, (2) as a platform for experimentation for data scientists and analysts, and (3) as a direct source for self-service business intelligence. The study also identifies several perceived benefits and challenges of the data lake approach. The results may be beneficial for both academics and practitioners. Further, suggestions for future research is presented.","Marilex Rea Llave","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.procs.2018.10.071","2018","Data lakes in business intelligence: reporting from the trenches"],["The importance and relevance of the discipline of statistics with the merits of the evolving field of data science continues to be debated in academia and industry. Following a narrative literature review with over 100 scholarly and practitioner-oriented publications from statistics and data science, this article generates a pragmatic perspective on the relationships and differences between statistics and data science. Some data scientists argue that statistics is not necessary for data science as statistics delivers simple explanations and data science delivers results. Therefore, this article aims to stimulate debate and discourse among both academics and practitioners in these fields. The findings reveal the need for stakeholders to accept the inherent advantages and disadvantages within the science of statistics and data science. The science of statistics enables data science (aiding its reliability and validity), and data science expands the application of statistics to Big Data. Data scientists should accept the contribution and importance of statistics and statisticians must humbly acknowledge the novel capabilities made possible through data science and support this field of study with their theoretical and pragmatic expertise. Indeed, the emergence of data science does pose a threat to statisticians, but the opportunities for synergies are far greater.","Hossein Hassani and Christina Beneki and Emmanuel Sirimal Silva and Nicolas Vandeput and Dag \u00d8ivind Madsen","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.techfore.2021.121111","2021","The science of statistics versus data science: What is the future?"],["Dashboards visualize a consolidated set data for a certain purpose which enables users to see what is happening and to initiate actions. Dashboards can be used by governments to support their decision-making and policy processes or to communicate and interact with the public. The objective of this paper is to understand and to support the design of dashboards for creating transparency and accountability. Two smart city cases are investigated showing that dashboards can improve transparency and accountability, however, realizing these benefits was cumbersome and encountered various risks and challenges. Challenges include insufficient data quality, lack of understanding of data, poor analysis, wrong interpretation, confusion about the outcomes, and imposing a pre-defined view. These challenges can easily result in misconceptions, wrong decision-making, creating a blurred picture resulting in less transparency and accountability, and ultimately in even less trust in the government. Principles guiding the design of dashboards are presented. Dashboards need to be complemented by mechanisms supporting citizens' engagement, data interpretation, governance and institutional arrangements.","Ricardo Matheus and Marijn Janssen and Devender Maheshwari","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.giq.2018.01.006","2020","Data science empowering the public: Data-driven dashboards for transparent and accountable decision-making in smart cities"],["This chapter presents the origin of medical data that comprises the core of any federated cloud platform that deals with medical data sharing and analytics.
