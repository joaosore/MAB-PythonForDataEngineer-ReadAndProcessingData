Today's security solutions require greater scalability and convenience in cloud-computing architectures, in addition to the ability to store and process larger volumes of data to address very sophisticated attacks. This paper explores some of the existing architectures for big data intelligence analytics, and proposes an architecture that promises to provide greater security for data intensive environments. The architecture is designed to leverage the wealth in the multi-source information for security intelligence.}, location = {Cardiff, United Kingdom}, series = {SIN '18}, pages = {1â€“4}, numpages = {4}, keywords = {analytics architecture, Big Data, Security Intelligence}}"
