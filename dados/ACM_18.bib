CDRs have traditionally been used for billing and network engineering purposes. Given how mobile phones have become an integral part of - and have undoubtedly transformed - the everyday life of a great part of the earth's population, and given that 90% or more of phone subscriptions are registered in any city, if CDRs are collected from the mobile phone and cellular networks, and combined with other data from the organization or from elsewhere, this will allow managers to identify trends, detect patterns, and glean other valuable findings from the data.This paper highlights the applicability of CDR-based big data, to gathering such insights. By stitching events together into clusters of related events across runtime environments and/or geographies, raw data becomes business insight to make decisions either to understand customer needs, to mitigate problems, or to ultimately gain a competitive advantage.}, location = {Dubai, United Arab Emirates}, series = {DATA '19}, pages = {1â€“7}, numpages = {7}, keywords = {CDR, random forest, city management, insights, traffic congestion, JSON, data analytics, mining algorithms, Hadoop, traffic management, big data, smart city}}"
