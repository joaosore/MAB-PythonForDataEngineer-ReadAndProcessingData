In dynamic assigning algorithm, student's answering times and answering correct rate for each education scenario in cloud based digital game learning system is considered. Suitable teaching scenario will be provided for individual user corresponding to personal learning ability. Each designed modular teaching materials can be embedded into the game platform on the virtual machine in cloud. The information about users in the individual game learning system can be stored in the cloud database. In addition, the whole learning system is established as a virtual machine. System maintainer can configure the learning system easily and quickly. Based on cloud, different remote devices can connect to server for learning.}, location = {Kaohsiung, Taiwan}, series = {ASE BD&amp;SI '15}, pages = {1â€“6}, numpages = {6}, keywords = {Game-Learning, Cloud Computing, Dynamic assigning algorithm, Digital game, Virtualization, Virtual Machine, RPG}}"
