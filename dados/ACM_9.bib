Recently there has been renewed interest in dependencies for improving the quality of data. The increasing demand for data quality technology has also motivated revisions of classical dependencies, to capture more inconsistencies in real-life data, and to match, repair and query the inconsistent data. This paper aims to provide an overview of recent advances in revising classical dependencies for improving data quality.}, location = {Vancouver, Canada}, series = {PODS '08}, pages = {159â€“170}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {dependency, data quality}}"
