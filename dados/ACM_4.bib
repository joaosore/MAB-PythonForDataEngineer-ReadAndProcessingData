Moreover, the increasing velocity, volume and variety of data requires new approaches for quality assessment. In this paper, a new approach for quality assessment is presented that applies metamorphic testing to data quality. The exemplary application of the approach on a big data application shows promising results for the suitability of the approach.}, location = {Montreal, Quebec, Canada}, series = {MET '19}, pages = {76â€“83}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {metamorphic data relations, quality assessment, data quality, metamorphic testing, big data}}"
