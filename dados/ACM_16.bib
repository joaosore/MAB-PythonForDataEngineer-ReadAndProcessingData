The process it describes unites three automated audits, - an audit of the database schema, an audit of the database structure and an audit of the database content. The audit of the database schema checks for design smells and rule violations. The audit of the database structure measures the size, complexity and quality of the database model. The audit of the database content processes the data itself to uncover invalid data values, missing records and redundant records. The purpose of these audits is to assess the quality of the database and to determine whether a data reengineering or data clean-up project is required.}, location = {Szeged, Hungary}, series = {WoSQ '11}, pages = {50â€“57}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {data auditing, data content validation, data quality, data metrics}}"
