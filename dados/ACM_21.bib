The Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithmthat is widely used for Big Data application. CBR has the ability to give a solution based on previous experiences like a human in making a decision. Thus, this study has designed and developed an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that utilized the CBR to suggest the most suitable learning material to the students based on the real-time information of the students' profiles. The application has been tested in actual setting and the results show that the students that have been presented with personalized learning materials performed significantly better than the students that were presented with non-personalized lessons. The application also has the ability to calculate the similarity between cases accurately and presented the students with the most suitable learning materials.}, location = {Osaka, Japan}, series = {ICBDR 2017}, pages = {28â€“32}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {Internet of Things, Instructional, Understanding, Mathematics, Interpersonal, Big Data, Intelligent Tutoring System, Algebra, Learning Style, Case-based Reasoning, Artificial Intelligence, Self-Expressive, Mastery}}"
