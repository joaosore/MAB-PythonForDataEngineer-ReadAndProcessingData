At Unravel, we build the next-generation APM platform for the big data stack, and we have worked with a representative sample of these enterprises that covers most industry verticals. This sample covers the spectrum of choices for deploying the big data stack across on-premises datacenters, private and public cloud deployments, and hybrid combinations of these. In this paper, we present a solution for assisting enterprises planning the migration of their big data stacks from on-premises deployments to the cloud. Our solution is goal driven and adapts to various migration scenarios. We present the system architecture we built and several cloud mapping options. We also describe a demonstration script that involves practical, real-world use-cases of the path to cloud adoption.}, location = {Amsterdam, Netherlands}, series = {SIGMOD '19}, pages = {1909â€“1912}, numpages = {4}, keywords = {big data stack, cloud migration, application performance management}}"
