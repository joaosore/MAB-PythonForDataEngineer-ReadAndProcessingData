It brought together international researchers in the interacting disciplines of data mining, systems biology, and bioinformatics at the Bloomberg Headquarters venue. The goal of this workshop is to encourage Knowledge Discovery and Data mining (KDD) researchers to take on the numerous challenges that Bioinformatics offers. This year, the workshop featured the theme of \"Knowledge discovery using big data in biological/biomedical systems\".}, pages = {726â€“728}, numpages = {3}}"
