By quickly understanding these hot issues, we can better supervise and prevent these problems in our life. In recent years, the problem of food safety appears frequently in our field of vision, which makes people have to regard food safety as a hot issue in today's social development. The state and relevant food safety supervision departments are also paying attention to the food safety problems. In order to better supervise food safety issues in this era of big data, this paper will analyze and study food safety issues with the help of popular technologies in the new era, such as artificial intelligence technology and big data technology, so as to formulate a new scheme to meet the needs of people in the new era for food safety supervision. Through the research, it can be found that a series of methods proposed in this paper can effectively provide new ideas for food safety big data visual analysis research method based on artificial intelligence.}, location = {Changsha, China}, series = {ICASIT 2021}, pages = {815â€“819}, numpages = {5}}"
