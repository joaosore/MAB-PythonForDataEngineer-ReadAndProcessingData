In related areas (such as Multimedia Big Data, Data Science and Multimedia Information Retrieval) a key step is commonly referred as Multimedia Indexing or Multimedia Big Data Analysis, where the aim is to represent multimedia content into smaller, more manageable units, allowing the extraction of data features and information essential to the proper performance of the associated services. This mini-course discusses current tools and techniques for indexing, extracting and processing of multimodal multimedia content. The techniques are exemplified in Python OpenCV over different content (like images, audio, text and video), leading to the interest of services like Netflix, Google and YouTube on this subject, attracting the interest of researchers and developers.}, location = {Rio de Janeiro, Brazil}, series = {WebMedia '19}, pages = {25â€“27}, numpages = {3}, keywords = {multimedia, big data, multimedia information retrieval}}"
