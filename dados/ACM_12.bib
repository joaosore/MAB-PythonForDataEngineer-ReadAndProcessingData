These exercises range in complexity from a paper and pencil thought exercise, to using Google Trends for simple explorations, to using a spread sheet to simulate the iterative nature of Google's PageRank algorithm, to programming with a Python based map-reduce framework. These exercises have been used in courses to train high school teachers in data science, full semester university courses (undergraduate and graduate), and CS education outreach efforts. Feedback has been positive as to their efficacy.}, location = {Larnaca, Cyprus}, series = {ITiCSE 2018}, pages = {373â€“374}, numpages = {2}, keywords = {Google Trends, Big data, Outreac, Map Reduce, PageRank}}"
