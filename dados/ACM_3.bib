A vast amount of research work has been done in the multimedia area, targeting different aspects of big data analytics, such as the capture, storage, indexing, mining, and retrieval of multimedia big data. However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the multimedia big data analytics, including the management and analysis of the large amount of data, the challenges and opportunities, and the promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this survey, which conducts a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research work on multimedia big data analytics. It also aims to bridge the gap between multimedia challenges and big data solutions by providing the current big data frameworks, their applications in multimedia analyses, the strengths and limitations of the existing methods, and the potential future directions in multimedia big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets the most recent multimedia management techniques for very large-scale data and also provides the research studies and technologies advancing the multimedia analyses in this big data era.}, pages = {1â€“34}, numpages = {34}, keywords = {machine learning, survey, mobile multimedia, 5V challenges, Big data analytics, multimedia analysis, multimedia databases, data mining, indexing, retrieval}}"
