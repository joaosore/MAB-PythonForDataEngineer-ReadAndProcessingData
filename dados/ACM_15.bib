An overall framework of shipbuilding big data platform is established in this paper, which is based on the relationships among the intelligent ship, cloud computing and big data. Then key techniques of big data are discussed in four aspects, including data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analysis. Finally, an overview of the architecture of big data and relevant techniques are demonstrated.}, location = {Shanghai, China}, series = {ICRAI 2017}, pages = {61â€“65}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {big data, data storage, data mining, data acquisition, intelligent ship, data visualization}}"
