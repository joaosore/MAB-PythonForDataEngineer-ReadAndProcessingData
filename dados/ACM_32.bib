Recently, Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) driven approaches are shown as having good predictive accuracy. 'Big Data' as input enhances the inferential power of algorithms, but it challenges even state-of-the-art computation methods. The runtime complexity of SVDD is linear in the number of support vectors. Hence speeding up the decision function becomes important for applications requiring fast real time performance. This work aims to provide solutions that reduce the computational complexity of SVDD so as to make one-class classification practical on Big Data. The proposed work first reduces the complexity of SVDD by computing a point known as the agent of the SVDD sphere center in the input space during the training phase. It retains the benefit of the kernel trick also. We then propose to hadoopize this lightly trained SVDD named as LT-SVDD so that a faster classification can be achieved in a big-data setting.}, location = {Salamanca, Spain}, series = {SAC '15}, pages = {931â€“932}, numpages = {2}}"
