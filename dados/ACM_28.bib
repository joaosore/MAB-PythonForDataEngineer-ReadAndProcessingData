Nowadays, many schools have thousands or even thousands of teachers, leading to the increase of a large amount of data such as various systems and databases operated by the school, such as management of school conditions and management performance analysis. How to use these data to transform existing management data into useful knowledge, improve school management decision-making, and improve school management level and quality is an urgent problem for schools to solve. This paper studies the intelligent educational administration management system based on big data technology. After understanding the relevant theories of big data technology and intelligent educational administration management system based on literature data, the intelligent educational administration management system based on big data technology is designed, and the designed system is tested, and the test results show that when the number of users in the system is 40, the average response time of the system is 0.31s, and the average response time of student score query is 0.63s, which basically meets the design requirements of the system.}, location = {Manchester, United Kingdom}, series = {AIAM2021}, pages = {1390â€“1394}, numpages = {5}}"
